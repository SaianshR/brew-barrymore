1,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,I didnt think i was going to give it a perfect score but Its looks smells tastes a 5 HOWEVER the mouth feel is NOT BY ANY MEANS EQUAL TO LOOK SMELL AND TASTE Pardon me i have to sit down Mouth feel is well 11 Yeh like twice as good as anything ive ever had before It grabs you by the face with both hands and says what was that that just went down my throat It tasted familiar like real pure butter on real Belgiumchocolate buttermilk pancakes with fresh highbush blueberries real Vermont maple syrup and Madagascar vanilla served with Seattle coffee and a shot of pappy,0.035921060405354976
2,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"So I just read a review that called the legendary KBBS “typical…white trash” It kinda made me nervous because I don’t dig whitepale stouts and I thought “how could I miss that this being a white stout”
Well happily that guy is drinking something else Or maybe he meant that KBBS is like Mountain Dew enjoyed by EuropeanAmericans whom the reviewer is afraid of Bah who cares
So KBBS Looks great poured into a wine stem Really dark lovely stuff There’s foam for those of you who judge beer based on foam Yep it’s present Looks like foam too 
The wine glass is supposed to enable the drinker to easily acquire aromas This one is heavy on the adjuncts and as a result heavy on aromas that should be present but not so overwhelming I am a lover of all things maple syrup so I enjoy it Underneath the maple I get pretty standard decent stout aromas of coffee cocoa and roasted grain Maybe mulberries Yeah mulberries have an aroma and it’s subtle but rather pleasant The additions aren’t artificial on the nose but just too much Kinda like someone skipped the basics and went right to breaking the rules I could go on at length about the fallacy of that approach but you don’t care 
After tasting many beers and learning how to pay attention to the different aspects of beer tasting I have found that reviewing the “front” “back” and finish is not NECESSARILY pretentious it’s simply that many reviewers are This one is actually kinda consistent The nose is pretty reliable in telegraphing the initial flavor The maple maple maple Yeah it’s real maple syrup and there’s a lot of it There’s definitely cocoa and quite possibly vanilla adjuncts present I am not going to trash this beer because of the adjuncts  I knew that going in But they’re aggressive Dark fruit on the finish for which I am grateful 
Given the abv and particular adjuncts I expected a boozy heavy feel with little carbonation and that is exactly it Again pleasant 
Of course some will reflexively say that the highest rated beers are overrated In this case I agree but that’s a reactionary approach This is a very enjoyable beer Of late I have become increasingly skeptical of adjunct stouts because I truly think that they are too quickly used when experience and talent can produce a world of flavors without just capriciously tossing stuff in a barrel In sum the score is ridiculously high But it’s too good to score it a protest one…",0.01970180415218472

Holy Fucking Shit KBBS Beer review 1000 Were finally here Legendary I absolutely splurged on this one but why not Morbid curiosity got the better of me I cant think of a better beer to review for this milestone than the highest rated beer in the whole damn world I do love maple as an adjunct so Im cautiously optimistic for this one I guess theres nothing to do now other than popping this open huh

Pours completely pitch black with no head into the signature branded stemless teku just a thin tan ring that leaves no lacing

The nose on this beer is an all out maple bomb but theres a nice subtlety to it as well Im picking up on aromas of real maple syrup light roast coffee sticky caramel pecan pie milk chocolate toasted oak and light earthy bourbon

Man I didnt want to like the taste of this as much as I do Its not the most complex thing Ive ever had but it is so goddamn good for what it is On the front end of the sip Im tasting sticky maple syrup caramel candy milk chocolate fruity coffee light oak toffee and raisin The swallow brings notes of fruity coffee sticky maple spicy bourbon milk chocolate espresso vanilla ice cream pecan pie and toasted oak Sublime

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a velvety beer Finishes surprisingly dry and boozy with a wonderful sweetness

I wont even play around this is fucking amazing Not top beer in the world amazing but it definitely cracks my top 10 This is truly a once in a lifetime beer experience I will likely never get another bottle again unless I make the trek out to Iowa with Pru who I allowed a few sips of this for his review but I will cherish every sip of this one More than the sum of its parts Cheers BA",0.11067431421857193

9,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"A Nightfall in appearance that presents a class of shades within the Bearded Iris Before the Storm Though the arriving predominance peers to schemes of an Ayam Cemani with dyed allocations on provoked methodical discharges Inasmuch as light charcoal to the late reposed tones of a Cayuga Duck given the dark purple to aerated greygreen exhales In conjunction a fallow headpiece that’s brief in withstanding preservation Yet justifiably welldesigned as the accents address the Beaver toned collapse with a Dutch white lip There is minimal adherence upon the necks fold as that portrayal comes in balmy goaded strides Notwithstanding the thermal development behind tackdistilled tears for adequately webbing church windows To that extent a multilayered scene that’s deep for optimization with each intermission 

S Malt is put into motion and characterized by the sweetrich lexicons with a thick trek for pure maple as a slight roasted bite aids in dimension Thereby ushering in dark chocolate on sticky toffee while puck tamping a quadsized shot in back There’s a pastiness in the peripheral that fastens the bourbon adhesion to coffee beans Coupled with an aerated basecoat for raisin molasses gems while strolling cold deciduous forests as red maple and birch bark circumference pine resin The barrel interiors coat figs and prunes beneath while malt soothes midriffs above before synergizing cask complexions Accordingly a caramel crème brûlée middle with a touch of frangipanehazelnut praline while the blend puts notice on vanilla oak staves The furtherance becomes rightly victimized by the prolonged exposure where opportunities pit meaty leather to spicepipe tobacco as marshmallow fondant faints to the barreled derived coconut This progresses to sawn wood from the recoiled temperate woodlands as a balminess curbs brandy to the dried fruit shifts and hard Chimes In the interim an oak sediment lingers with a dry hop bite amongst ricocheting malt as bourbon pitches flat densities to the rhythm behind soft tannins

T A proactive start on clean maple that measures a light bourbon dictation against roasted grains as esters serenely interweave The blend fondues oak atop Barhi Dates and Pain aux raisins while summersaulting around prunes before paying heed to Lemberger grapes That aside foretaste is mainly situated on rich Ganache over maple poffertjes as a robust earthiness tends juneberries to dark rosin cascades Midpalate opens malt to bready dexterities with reacting nutswalnuts in the act of a polymer coalescence Chiefly a league for barrel mechanics besides toasted grains as the equidistant hovers around caramelized toffee and chocolate cordials In a prolongedtimely struggle the progression veers off of fudge fondant for more complex  wooded  polymers set to vanillin staves and oakedsmoked book shelves Moreover a greenhouse effect that becomes prevalent in the orchestration of deferred intervals In light of oxygenating restfully across the hours the blend incriminates Bual from Madeira regions and suggests charred figs with dried marzipan In turn a distantly placed roasted bite to the inclining warming degree as the blend’s anatomy codas tarry skins with Mozhee extractions

M A level of fatness that’s rich in fluidity for levying a smooth composited viscosity The mechanics attend carbonation cautiously by truncating the spectrum for warming coordination behind that semitamed glueyness Such factors roadmap a weighing scale as vitrics breath open air and course a drying constitute In passing the approach offers an adhesiveness without taxing saccharinity while protracting an earthly bite to waddle an exsiccation with light caustic tannin physiques

O The framework provides a eurythmic nature on maple with a backing around barrel warmth and an elusive sense to earthy livelihoods In centering agenda the woody hop influence remains docile to the gravity behind malts blended depth yet prompts in for balance and refines ester institution on clocked time Consequently forest fruits and backwoods are shrouded by a tugofwar sense of heft but consciously linger with a palate fondness in step",0.06580572120312451

20,Vanilla Bean Assassin,"Unofficially my last beer of the top 250 had the trade secured for it before changes were made to calculations making me 20 short again

It glugs out of the bottle super thick and tar black It has a finger and a half head of tight thick khaki bubbles that recedes slowly to a thin film and collar that retain throughout Leaves some nice legs on the glass when swirled

Immediate strong aromas of boozy bourbon are softened by sweet vanilla and lightly toasted marshmallow Fudgey brownie batter brown sugar molasses caramel toasted coconut and charred oak all follow Theres just a hint of figs linger in the background

The flavor is quite bourbon forward but very round and smooth Its like a scoop of real vanilla bean ice cream topped with burnt caramel artisan fudge and a shot of high end bourbon Nothing pops much except maybe the bourbon but this is quite well balanced

The mouth feel is thick but not overly so Its slick and coats the mouth well lingering and begging you to take another sip Just the right amount only a touch of carbonation and a bone dry slightly boozy finish Superb

Overall this is an absolute pleasure of a beer to drink and a worthy one for my last of the 250 list It doesnt blow me away in the flavor department but it does in its balance and roundedness Those are things hard to find in modern BA adjunct stouts The fact that I could EASILY solo dome this bottle says something",0.0793051585718144

As the flavors roll along the middle palate a full and lavish saturation of the tastebuds reveal bold complementary flavors of espresso bittersweet chocolate white chocolate sweet wines and savory sherry port and madeira Hinting toward soy sauce a late and whisky soaked taste of bourbon keeps the complex flavors of coconut caramel toasted oak and bourbon spice coming sip after sip

40,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"This is a beer Ive been wanting to try for some time now was able to obtain it in a trade for Fremont B5K

The beer pours fairly dark blackish brown color with good head retention and considerable lacing The beer certainly looks impressive enough On the nose I pick up vanilla green chili peppers some chocolate underlying coffee and considerable whiskey The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely though I thought it a bit hot on the finish something that is especially noticeable given the chili flavor in this beer That being said the barrel aging seems to mute the base beer flavors in this beer somewhat and really doesnt seem to blend in all that well It does add another flavor componentdimension which is always nice but the whiskey flavor otherwise doesnt seem to bring a lot to the party in this beer Mouthfeel is fairly full otherwise and the alcohol seemed to be pretty well integrated into the flavor profile Drinkability is pretty good though its hard to imagine drinking more than a small amount of this beer at a sitting

49,Heady Topper,"Ive been waiting over 10 years to try this and while I never went too far out of my way to try and acquire it recently a 3day weekend vacation in Vermont finally provided me with a case of pints from a quiet local liquor store in the middle of nowhere

And maybe this is 10 years of anticipation talking but eh Well no its not eh its incredibly well made for the style but Im a juicy NEIPA guy the piney intensity of most DIPAs usually turn me off and it does here as well The look is a typically nice yellow haze and the smell is the best thing about the beer  full of different aromas with pine leading the charge followed by lemon rind and white pepper

In my opinion dont listen to the can pour it in a glass as the complex and powerful aroma is the best thing going here and needs to be experienced

Now we get to the less favorable parts which is the mouthfeel and aftertaste Powerful mouth coating pine which is what some people look for but not me But the worst part is the intense carbonation and gassiness Im burping after two sips and bloated by the time the can is done

Next I poured most of the rest into a mug Pale orangestraw body very hazy with a rich creamy white head that quickly shrunk to a cap that lasted leaving rings of lacing The taste is best this way and represents a wellmade Imperial New England style IPA 

Next I added in the dregs and I can see why this is not recommended The haze changed to cloudy and turbid the taste changed to peppery bitter with a slight funky juiciness I dont mind the dregs the white pepper bitterness hides the alcohol and keeps the sweet juice taste in check

Medium bodied with plentiful carbonation bold bitter and still balanced but I wouldnt call it smooth Lightly colored for the style and begs the question Should there be an Imperial NEIPA category

Taste Opens up with a barrage of citrus fruits and resinous pine sap that seemingly gain strength as they develop Peaches mango and mixed berries pop up both together and separate as the journey continues and dankness also makes it presence known here and there in nososubtle ways Malt sweetness tries to keep up but is continually beaten back by the hops and closes with a coniferladen finish and a delectable strong bite

Feel It has a slick and oily mouthfeel with a relatively soft carbonation Medium bodied

Overall This is my first time trying Heady Topper as well as my first time trying anything from Alchemist There is so much hype around this beer so it was almost impossible to live up to it But it actually manages to come pretty close What I find most interesting about this beer is that it is so different from New EnglandStyle IPAs that are made by 90 of breweries today To me this beer is more West Coast at heart than it is an NEIPA This beer reminds me of Lagunitas Super Cluster which I know is allCitra hopped and I do not know which hops are used in Heady Topper I would think that there at least has got to be Citra in here too though Also reminds me a bit of Foley Brothers Prospect",0.0

Taste  As with the nose it was like breakfast for dinner The maple syrup seemed to saturate the stout permeating the body The beer was not overly sweet but was balanced by the coffee notes It seemed as though the coffee was washing down the sweetness Notes of semisweet chocolate same toward the back but the overall profile of chocolate chip pancakes with maple syrup lingered

The Crimson Kings balcony beer indeed

Wow It really is cranked up about as high as could be in terms of orangey lupuline saturation Drinks like Orange Crush toilet wine made in a Scandinavian whitecollar prison in heaven That or an Orange Julius from hell Either way only the best 

Big and rich and fruity and creamy and boozy It is big enough to require easing into while never approaching harshness or anything offputting in the flavor Lovely look to it Aroma and flavor are an at once complicated and simple blend of tangerine clementine apricots grapefruit rind dipped in honey pithy citrus oil weed that has been rehydrated using orange peel I could go on Again wow 

Like with most of the IIPAs from TH this is as close to perfect as you can get A balance of all the individual components of the style each unique each cranked to 11 but each in total harmony with the others Textbook example of what the style can be

One other thing I want to add here for no real reason I am far from a TH expert but I have a decently experienced palate and have had a few dozen of their beers over the years These are the first of their beers Ive had in a couple years cause of the pandemic and damned if their packaging has not gotten even more incredible at least compared to the best packaging you find in Quebec A month old and just mellowed right into itself No vague hints of oxidation no fading or changing profile over the few cans Ive had of this and others ranging up to a month and a half old Anyway cheers to the canning line Based on their many date code messages Ive seen over the years and including this one I think wed all enjoy sitting around listening to music together You guys rock

Review 1200 For this landmark review Im tackling the highest rated Traditional Lambic on BA which also happens to be the 10th highest rated beer overall on the site This one has been a huge want for me for quite some time now so Im happy I managed to source a bottle I will drink half of this immediately and decant the other half for about 20 minutes as suggest by 3F and others who have reviewed to see the difference I will take the highest of the 2 for the official rating but Im sure that will be the decanted version Lets pop it open

Pours a cloudy deep orange with just a thin ring of bubbles which obviously leaves no lacing Expected for the style and I dont think decanting will make a difference in this regard

The first whiff of this tells me that decanting is probably the move as it feels like it needs to open up a bit first Predecant Im picking up on aromas of peat smoke leather oxidized sherry wet hay and white wine vinegar Postdecant Im picking up on aromas of lemon juice tart peach white peppercorn oxidized sherry wet hay wheat cracker toasted oak light smoke and stone

The same applies for taste this is super funky and almost aggressive predecant On the front end of the sip Im tasting lemon juice olorosso sherry sharp oak leather sweet honey and light smoke The swallow brings notes of peat smoke wet hay old leather vinegar sharp oak lemon zest and apple skin Postdecant it really opens up On the front end of the sip Im tasting lemon juice pear skin oxidized sherry toasted oak earthy wheat wet hay and a touch of peat smoke The swallow brings notes of oxidized sherry peat smoke wet hay lemon zest tart peach wheat bread stone light leather and sharp oak

Much like the appearance I dont think decanting will have any effect on the mouthfeel A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a sharp and funky beer Finishes bone dry with a hefty funk This is so damn refreshing that I could literally chug it but obviously I wouldnt do that

126,Pliny The Younger,"Pours a slight dark gold with a light frost to the transparency Head is a couple fingers of plush white foam 

Aroma is a pleasant quick hit of tropical fruits citrus and mild resin and grass It melds together sugary hop notes seamlessly with sticky hops for a dramatic dynamic quickhitting aroma Light bready malts adorn the back of the aroma profile but are faint in comparison to the hops Hops are never loud instead they land at a mild volume of six on a scale of 110 ten being the highest Instead of using volume hops are overlapped to create complexity 

Flavor profile is light tropical fruits and citrus at the onset sharing the spotlight with resiny grassy piney and mild herbal and floral hops before dipping back into tropical fruits at the finish Pine notes build in intensity as the beer warms but it refrains from crossing into overly sticky or heavy Its never overtly sweet nor does it carry a bitter bite at the end as do some west coast IPAs Instead the end is marked by a light dryness that marks an end to hops That dryness is accompanied by bready malts 

Mouth feel is mediumthick with a consistent crisp texture driven by a mild effervescence Its just thick enough to drink more like an experience and less like a parking lot tailgating IPA  though I would never turn down a pour  bottle of this in the latter situation 

Overall this beer embodies wonderful balance along with thoughtful nuance to create a dreamy smooth IPA Hops are pleasant plump and forward without carrying the pedaltothemetal force of some other IPAs This one is marked and adorned by simplicity and nuance

128,Pliny The Younger,"Appearance  The beer poured a clear golden color with visible carbonation and a white head

Smell  The earthy pine notes were strong in the nose By way of comparison it smelled like in the amped up version of Elder 

Taste  Having sampled Pliny the elder first I will use it as a means of comparison Younger seemed like an amped up version of Elder The green grass and hops was next level The pine notes left a little room for sweetness but there was somewhat of a backbone The pain notes lingered in the finish 

Mouthfeel  The beer had the body of an imperial with carbonation scrubbing away the sweetness and allowing the bitterness to linger

This one pours a very dark black color with a small head and no lacing

This smells very strongly of coconut with loads of milk and dark chocolate very slight roast light bourbon and lots of creamy vanilla

This is definitely sweet but honestly not as sweet as I expected This really does meet the hype that it garners  its exactly what you want out of high quality pastry The coconut is done so well its so bright and vibrant and just plain tasty Theres a little bit of barrel it helps anchor the beer slightly The vanilla is also done very well and its all just layered on top of a very tasty and creamy base beer

This is very creamy and rich with no real booziness to it at all Its very very drinkable

142,Fundamental Observation,"I had both the 2018 and 2019 vintage This review is for the 2019 vintage The 2019 is not substantially different going off memory although I think the body mouthfeel is a little thicker

Surprisingly at 3 years this beer hasnt lost much any vanilla although refrigerated most of that time 

The best part of this beer is either the taste or the smell The nose is loaded with what reminds me of buttercream icing  with a hint of something else Perhaps the alcohol that you get off vanilla extract The taste is similar but the buttercream on the taste is more of something you have to use your imagination for Its the essence but not direct flavor Lots of deep fudgy chocolate A bit of alcohol on the back end which is unusual but I suspect is a result of the interaction with the vanilla While tasty I wouldnt say that the taste is complex

145,Fundamental Observation,"Serving 1 Pt 09 Fl oz bottle poured into a Founders CBS snifter This is the 2019 edition so a little age on it Sorry its all I could find The bottle has 2 check boxes though one for drink fresh and one for cellar and save and the latter is checked So Im at least following the rules

A Pours super dark and thick motoroil like Nice lacing up the glass Minimal offwhite head that fades quickly

S Huge vanilla up front Its like extract maybe vanilla coffee creamer Super on the nose with a little bourbon note behind it 

T Again vanilla is the centerpiece Its a real sweet vanilla note here I know its not extract but its so concentrated and strong Bourbon there on the finish really a second player to the vanilla 

M This is where this beer really excels Nice full mouthfeel Very balanced The vanilla is huge but so is the bourbon Feels like everything is in HD Way chewier and thick than some of the more recent BCBS beers Ive had

O Okay well This is very good Ill start by saying I am not familiar with BL at all I always noticed FO at the top of the 250 list but it was so out of reach I didnt think much of it Was very fortunate to take a vacation to SF recently and a shop still had some 19 bottles left Seems like the big comparison point with this beer is BCBVS which I can totally see I havent had that beer in some time so this isnt a 11 But Ill say just from memory that this beer is every bit as good if not better My initial impression is that I like the mouthfeel and balance of this beer more But I do feel the vanilla flavor of BCBVS might be a tough better This is really strong and vanilla forward and its a really sweet and pastrylike vanilla Not that I want it subdued in any way but BCBVS has it reeled in and maybe a little more naturaltasting I really feel like Im splitting hairs here At the end of the day its huge props to BL for making a really good chewy balanced BA stout Oh and I think the age may have even helped this beer I get no sense of oxidation or fading of flavor Again the vanilla is huge on this

146,Fundamental Observation,"The beers pours the expected blackish brown color with minimal lacing and fair at best head retention This beer has the look of a beer that has seen some pretty significant barrel aging though its not overly viscous On the nose I get dark chocolate and vanilla with underlying bourbon and light licorice Its nice but I was expecting a more robust aroma profile The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet stout but with a much greater level of intensity Mouthfeel is fairly full with a long moderately sweet finish Carbonation seemed to be on the low side which I tend to think works well with rich BA impy stouts like this one Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile though you can tell its up there a bit Even so theres no way I would guess an abv in the 14 range 

This is a very nice BA impy stout no doubt though I guess I was expecting a bit more complexity Im glad I had the opportunity to try it but Im not sure its a beer Id go out of my way to find Still a very solid beer",0.09911197057469107

170,Very Hazy,really cool to get to drink this so thankful i have people in my life who want to share this kind of thing with me but i am just shocked that this comes in at number 15 on the BA top beers list like in the entire world seems outlandish for something i would not even describe as insanely well refined or anything and yeah the hop profile is great but it also has some burn some unneeded weight feels under carbonated to me and really doesnt distinguish itself as elite in any way that might sound harsh if this was from my local watering hole i would be pretty stoked but to get all in a tizzy about it is simply foolish which is not true of all the tree house hyped hazy ones by the way but is true about this one super dense looking from the 12 ounce can high frothy white headed and all but dull a little bit and chewy not as maybe well refined as expected or as very green was pretty much right next to it i wish they told you the hops but then i guess everyone would copycat it but it seems somewhat conventional like citra could be driving it along with something just slightly spicy at this dosage a bit of bitterness which i dont hate short of green burn a fine line in this style and they walk it but i am perhaps seeking a little more it warms up favorably before the alcohol takes over i get green pear orange tic tac candy and a little white grape its tasty even downright awesome and i like the way it kind of permeates the tongue and hangs after each swallow its semi permanent on the palate not oily or slick feeling through truly a new england type to its core minimal grain flavor but all the body in the world nobody would call this balance and i dont need it to be but it seems big for the sake of it like the hops dont even want this much structure and not that its forced but just that its not perfect as the ratings seem to suggest i like their yeast and its used well here its a little short on bubbles for a big one at least for my preferences and overall the flavor cannot be denied this is yummy but is it objectively amazing beer leagues better than the rest in this space heck no one of the more anticipated but least epic tree house beers ive cut into which is still to say its still excellent but it certainly has a peer group,0.0

S The cask recitals circumference the subtle earthy hop effects which quarter the esters while building a strong dexterity around sweet – bready – malt An inclination on dark fruit that ranges to elderberries when exhibiting dated prunes amongst raisins Sequentially an armored disposition on Crème caramel that’s been slightly browned to aptness before taxing in a Mackintosh bar The inclining humidity brawns a treacliness over a Black Forest Chocotorta amp liquored truffles while pitting leathery advances against brown sugar tobacco Synchronously a hop bite to softly cuddle malts candied advances on creamed variations when sylvan elements develop upon the tarry dried fruit inclinations With this in mind a bittering – woodsy – expansion that’s deepening on pine resin around timberlands yet a facilitating aid to not overextend the greenery virulence Moreover a step that nears Goobers with a charred following on walnuts besides stale cherry bitters to coriaceous stipulations Oxidation is lightly pressed against the late solvent esters that work to benefit the movement by suggesting a Pedro Ximénez cleverness while barreling the oak staves at length

T Bourbon continually pillars the complexity with a warming – humid – torridness on malt as hops lightly frame a woodsy path The elements touch on a caramelized fig custard while parading crystallized stone fruit in a molasses – marshmallow – soufflé Secondly a posturing sweetness to neighbor an unwanted cloyingness in balminess however a position that’s impeccably groomed to cloak heat In sequence a spice to fruit component that prompts Ethyl Caproate under the residual malt pleasantness There is an ongoing sentience over the varying cask proportions which are competently equipped to gamble on the sustained aeriation Thusly meandering polymers to further provokestrengthen vanillin aside honeyed spices while continuing to calibrate the oak lactones The barrel presence continues on to address almonds with lightly shredded coconut as a hard Skor emanates against fudge In addition liquored raisins applied to charring when shriveled cherries pass cordials amp cola taffy once hops attune that backwoods kick to face grape – brandy – bugs A measure that becomes thirsting of tannin stipulations in the patient exertions as dried leaves spread from a nearby – progressive – ruin 

M Sidesteps underattenuation in the inclusive duty of not overwhelming the rich records Nonetheless the approach is sweet with a chewy dexterity and a warming sensation while carbonation is handled in a judicious manner An approach that does not burn or madden the slick feel as longevity offers a calm smoothness in the act of intellectualizing a system over the dry oak tannin mannerisms 

O A hop bill that’s cautiously tempered against a glucose powerhouse which bypasses the aggressiveness on bite while still prominent to ally the esters They offer a balance to the finer points on wood amid the several transfers as malt sweetens the complexity chronologically in anticipation of the craftily dry hooks An onset that’s censoring on depth with a tough buildout albeit an advantageousmore beneficial buildout if given the patience to draw out time",0.021891396182908494

Appearance Black with a small dark beige head that quickly faded Age probably took a big hit on the head size

Smell Fairly prominent bourbon aromas and moderate coffee aromas Not bad but again age is a factor here as well as the appearance

Taste Bourbon notes prominent coffee notes mild brown sugar notes and mild tannic oak notes The coffee comes off a touch bitter but considering the age of the beer its not bad and provides a nice counter to the bourbon notes

Mouthfeel Mediumlbodied with a fairly low level of carbonation Not a bad mouthfeel but age is a factor

184,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"Goose Island – Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout BCBCS – 2014 

126 ABV 

The beer is listed as “Stout – American Imperial” on BA 

The beer was removed from a 40ish degree temp fridge after having been refrigerated for approximately 2 years Beer poured into 2012 BCBS snifter 

First Impression Pours dark thinner than BCBS 45 

Appearance Standard Bourbon County An aggressive pour years only a small amount of khaki head that fades quickly leaving only a small ring around the glass 425

Smell Coffee up front Mostly this coldbrew smelling with a hint of grounds and also the dread ‘pepper’ Weak barrel on the nose 425

Taste 2014 and earlier BCBCS is what all coffee stouts should be judged on for me As the kids say ‘it fucks’ And after this many years to still say that Come on Taste starts with the coffee shifts to bourbon pulls in some chocolate fudge brownies shifts back to bourbon finishes on coffee and then a slow finish lasts for longer than most BA stouts let alone BA coffee stouts Impressive for 125 abv 470

Mouthfeel Coffee stouts are always thinner than their regular counterparts They just are While this is clearly thinner than the regular not appreciably so For judging this against other coffee stouts this is still upper echelon 475

Overall This is a great beer and I’m jamming on this I debated about whether to have this tonight because I have to get up in 45 hours to hit the BCBS release Well I’m glad I did but only because I chose to drink this tonight It’s really fantastic It’s incredible how well this has held up I did have this a few years back just once and while it was great I don’t remember enjoying it quite this much This is just singing tonight It’s everything that I want And the finish just keeps going I’m in heaven All this said – could it be better Of course I’d love to have even more barrel I’d love to see how this shined at 15 But for what it is and compared to others this is Heaven 465

185,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"Bottled 72517 cracking this open just over 4 years later

Oh boy we have quite the whale here From what Ive heard the coffee BCBS is one of the most sought after variants and 2017 is unfortunately the last vintage I never really expected to see it on a shelf anywhere However when visiting DC this past weekend I decided to pop in a liquor store to search for some of the Dogfish Head spirits since we dont get those up here in Mass Well I found their whiskey and was happy but decided to check out the beer selection This one was staring at me and I immediately snatched it without looking at the price tag Worth it Lets find out

Pours a velvety black with a finger of dark tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing but very strong legs

This is wonderfully balanced between roasty and sweet in the nose like a decadent coffee drink mixed to perfection Im picking up on aromas of chewy caramel lightly acidic coffee chocolate covered espresso beans vanilla creme ripe fig smooth oak and just the slightest hint of sweet blueberry

The fact that this has such a strong coffee presence after 4 years is very impressive Many of these beers tend to fall off in flavor pretty quick but it is beautifully preserved here despite not being full force On the front end of the sip Im tasting creamy vanilla lightly spicy bourbon milk chocolate medium acidic coffee and light grape The swallow brings notes of decadent milk chocolate oily espresso beans burnt toast a touch of that vegetal green pepper character others have complained about in older bottles and earthy oaked bourbon on the aftertaste

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a thick and viscous beer Finishes mostly dry from the bourbon heat

This beer is awesome It doesnt quite crack my top 10 though I suspect it might if fresher Regardless Im very happy to have tried this one and heres to hoping they bring it back next year",0.19069251784911845

Smell Very rich coffee and bourbon a bit of chocolate No green pepper

Taste Phenomenally smooth and deep Starts with bourbon shifts to dark acidic coffee grinds finishes with a delightful burnt bread roast My only demerit is that I find the bourbon ever so slightly too dominant on some finishes

Feel Fullbodied but not too heavy with light carbonation Bit of alcohol on the finish but not too much

Overall Its a huge beer really well puttogether Its a bourbonlovers coffee stout with a very prominent bourbon character that somehow still doesnt mask the big coffee base",0.3142857142857143
189,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"2013 Vintage  Los Inmortales Coffee 

335ml bottle  lightly chilled poured into a snifter

Appearance Pours a coalblack hue  slightly thin with a deep reddishmahogany ring around the top edge Zero head zero foam zero collar Just sits like liquoricecoloured liquid in the glass Lifeless

Nose Surpriseingly the coffee is still here  and quite strong The coffee is deep dark roasty and pungent with an almost stale quality to it  like a gas station coffee maker that hasnt been emptied or cleaned in a day It almost smells sticky and concentrated very much like Kaluha Zero green pepper Theres some deep roast beneath the coffee along with a bit of an ashensmoky note Some tangy dark fruit peeks through as well as some bourbon and if you really dig deep some vanilla oak and bakers chocolate emerge Not much warmth Coffee dominates

Palate This 7 year old stout greets the palate fairly sweet with some rich chocolate fudge brownie batter vanilla bourbon and oak before an intense coffee presence explodes and takes the lead Its a miracle theres still so much coffee in here The coffee is sweet black roasty with some fresh whole bean notes Saturated almost like coffee liqueur and then finally showing some of that stale back coffee character A whisper of tangy dark fruit pokes out before some coffee bean bitterness begins to show quickly compounded by blackened malt bitterness drying this out very quickly and fully Some more subtle bourbon followed by some less subtle barrel reappear and the finish approaches bringing sticky black coffee roasty beans bitter malt roast pure cacao charred malt and spicy charred oak No lingering sweetness

MouthfeelBody Admittedly I expected this to be thin given its age but surprisingly its actually packing some nice heft when chilled It isnt luscious or chewy but before it warms it does have some nice viscosity though it does thin out as it warms Effervescence is extremely low  not still and there is some subtle fuzz in there but like a cup of soda the morning after you poured it Quite sticky around the lips but almost fully dries out in the finish with all that roast

Overall This is a difficult one to rate Is it fair to formally review and rate a 7 year old coffee stout that Ive never had It may actually not be Ill never know how this was when fresh but even now Id say this is a perfectly respectable barrelaged coffee stout Strong coffee presence no green pepper notes essentially no oxidation and maybe just a hint of staleness to the coffee The bourbon and barrel are subdued and the effervescence is lacking but asis this is still a great coffee stout The fact that it has held up so well is definitely a testimony to the earlymid BCBS era Smoke em if you got em This is the most you could ask for in a 7 year old coffee stout I have to wonder if the 2013 was particularly coffeeforward because apparently less ancient bottles have already lost their beans Certainly not the case here but I wouldnt hold onto one any longer than this Gracefully aged",0.258418727070721

Drinking this is comparable to drinking cold brew coffee concentrate that I forgot to water down The intensity of flavors makes this absolutely unique The relatively short time in the barrels seems to leave the oaky depths and nuance behind in favor of a massive straight up bourbon presence This works well with the strong toffee and raisin base This does not represent my favorite approach to double barrel barleywine I will continue to buy multiples of everything Kane offers at a fraction of the price while this is a one and done purchase But these are flavors I enjoy at intensity levels that no one else offers If you are curious I say try this once This is leaps and bounds better than Wendigo",0.0574959574576069

Aroma is raisins fig toffee molasses and dark fruits mashed together with leathery spicy bourbon Barrel adds additional char and heat which is smoothed out well by hearty caramel toasty and bready malts That dark fruit character really starts to swell up and become a much more major player in the aroma as the beer warms

Flavor profile is fig raisins toffee molasses brown sugar and hearty dark fruits Grassy hops add some resinous hop presence which introduces some pleasant variation to the profile that is not a sugary note heavy malt or bourbon Bourbon is present throughout but becomes much more present on the back half of the flavor profile building up heat and complexity akin to the way a snowball builds rolling down a hill Despite that build up it never runs away with heat Underneath it all is strong caramel bready and toasty malts 

Mouth feel is thick with a still effervescence offering up some light bubbles at the start before smoothing out at the midway point A very light silt adds some further texture but really its smooth The texture matches both the aging process output and alcohol suggesting this beer has been slowly pressed flat by the act of time and heavy alcohol

82 New England style IPA by Treehouse

Poured into a tulip glass today from a pint can dated 712 

The body pours a dark pineapple yellow with a fluffy head Very good lacing throughout the tasting 

Magnificent aroma Pineapple Orange passion fruit lemon notes and a dankness provide a pleasurable experience This aroma is the feature of the NE style that I like most Use a tulip glass and enjoy the aroma throughout 

The taste begins with a slight bitterness that quickly dissipated into a light dankness Easy finish as the light bitterness reappears Super easy drinking 

Mouthfeel is good soft but not oat soft",0.02917299829957891

Appearance Deep gold color with 3finger white head It is deep with a very hazy complexion like many New England IPAs Head is very thick and it lasts a few minutes leaving a small covering There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass

Smell Strong aroma of citrus and pine as well as some hops and pineapple The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas

Taste Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus The sweetness and bitter edge are wellbalanced Has a very nice aftertaste that lasts a moderate amount of time Overall a nice balance and very drinkable

Mouthfeel Medium body Average alcohol which matches the 68 listed on the can

Mouthfeel is about medium but the zesty carbonation makes it seem lighter Personally just a touch too much for my tastes

The taste is very similar as well although this tastes slightly more malty and the feel is definitely nowhere near as chewy I get much more melon lingering after the sip has faded as well

Holy Fucking Hell I’m finally having this beer and my lucky review 777 This beer is the result of my first beer trade ever thanks to the incredible fo5s Much appreciated bro I’ve had this marked as a want on here for just about 3 years This is the 1 fruit Lambic and has been for quite some time It currently sits at 17 overall and I can’t think of a better beer for my personal 777 as a very highly regarded apricot Lambic I actually have a few trades going for different vintages of this with updated reviews to come Alright I know that was a lot of numbers let’s just get into it now

Pours an opaque pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

This smells absolutely heavenly Even with over a year of age on it the fruit hasnt faded like some say that it has Im assuming its more prominent in a fresher batch but its wonderful here too Im picking up on aromas of jammy dried apricot white wine vinegar sharp oak aged leather white grape earthy wheat doughy malt light pepper and lemon rind

This is unreal in taste as well and not nearly as sharply sour as the aroma would suggest On the front end of the sip Im tasting juicy apricot underripe peach wheat bread straw pear juice lemon rind and light oak The swallow brings notes of jammy dried apricot sharp oak white wine vinegar peach rings lemon rind crackery malt lime juice and old leather

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a crisp and tart beer Finishes mostly dry but leaves a slight film behind on the tongue from the residual sugars

I honestly think this might be the one of the best beers Ive ever had Everything is so nuanced but flavorful at the same time The 6 abv keeps it beyond drinkable almost crushable but that is not what I wanna do with this beer Im gonna cherish every last drop of this one With the others I get Ill see how it develops over time Another massive shoutout to fo5s for this one Cheers BA",0.0

Look Pours an opaque bright yellowish orange color with a frothy offwhite head that has small to mediumsized bubbles

Smell I can see why they call this Very Green It has a lot of green grassy and piney aromas Theres also a lot of tropical and citrus fruit aromas  pineapple orange grapefruit Creamy notes also Smells like many other Tree House beers that I have had before

Taste Its a bit more interesting than the nose suggests Up front its fruity and juicy But that personality trait quickly fades as the finish is long and bitter yet not very aggressive at first It really is a green finish with big vegetal grassy flavors including pine mint lots of citrus pith The second sip was much less juicy and sweet up front already the second sip is bitter up front as the bitterness builds on the palate As much as you get the flavor of the fruit of the pineapple you get the flavor of the green pineapple stalks

Feel The mouthfeel is soft and creamy

Overall Ive said it before and I am sadly saying it again I am largely unimpressed by Tree House New England IPAs This beer is just not very flavorful or enjoyable for me There are so many other beers that I would rather be drinking I can still honestly say that it is a wellmade beer but its just not made according to my tastespreferences and therefore I rated it accordingly I guess that so many people like this beer because it gives a hop fix along with a super creamy mouthfeel Its just lacking some elements to make it an enjoyable beer for me",0.014744195615489713

Nose is of tropical and citrus fruits Initially just sweet fruit scent as it warms a more bitter pithy aroma seeps into the background

More complex than the nose lets on although the beginning is straightforward tropical fruits and Mandarin oranges Midway through theres a more pithy bitter happiness The level of bitterness is just right to add a shade of complexity to things without clashing with what came before Things finish off smoothly with a slightly dry bitter zap to the palate

The beer poured the expected blackish brown color with minimal lacing and not much in the way of head retention Still I didnt think this was particularly unusual for a ba impy stout On the nose Im picking up dark chocolate light licorice some vanilla and a hint of cherry Not really getting much of any bourbon The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this moderately sweet stout but with a slight roasty component as well Mouthfeel is fairly full and the finish is pretty long As others have noted theres some sort of odd flavor in the finish Its not bad just unusual a slight wet cardboard flavor Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile which I appreciate 

This is a nice beer no doubt but the accolades this beer garners is a bit of a head scratcher Likewise the price tag for this beer is a puzzler as well I ordered 3 ba impy stouts at Ansaris and the Assassin was clearly low man on the totem pole a ba coconut stout from 608 brewing from Wisconsin was vastly superior to the Assassin Whatever Each to their own This is still a pretty good impy stout but given the value quotient for this beer Im pretty sure this isnt something Ill ever need to order again",0.05936521771955248

On the pour a white nearly three finger head forms after a minute or two it slightly recedes making more room to pour and I am able to get the head over the rim over the glass Head becomes quite rocky but has very good retention Carbonation after the pour looks quite ligjt and lazy Body is a slightly dark gold On the paler side of a lot of IPAs and with a very slight chill haze Laces very nicely

Aroma is quite bright with a hit of resinous grapefruit sweet hops Some malt sweetness comes through but the hops are very big on this one A very sweet floral and citric smelling beer Nothing off and very clean More juicy than I expected

Taste is similar to the aroma but a lot of the fruity qualities are traded for a big wave of bitterness that slowly fades leaving a resinous zesty but sweet and malty finish that lingers but is very nicely balanced after the big wave of hops Despite the abv I cant really detect alcohol as the hops actually cover it up Despite being super hoppy this isnt a mess and is very drinkable with a nice hop evolution that gives a good balance of bite to flavor

Feel is soft and dangerously drinkable with a perfectly balanced carbonation bite to softness provided by the head Honestly this is tasty af and Im not an ipa guy nobody does everything right and maintains the balance This feels like a benchmark and I could drink this all summer long if it wasnt 8 and so damn expensive

Overall this beer is very hyped up Dont get me wrong its very good Theres essentially nothing wrong with it the bitterness isnt cloying but is pleasantly present and its big and hoppy without forgetting its a malt drink It even looks beautiful Its the perfect IPA but everyone is trying to imitate it so unless this is youre whale you probably have a general idea of how this tastes youve just had a similar but inferior beer Is it worth the price Maybe maybe not though 799 for the bottle at a store in Colorado Maybe I got scammed",0.04118025571216554

Overall Very complex west coast style IIPA that combines a typical piney and woody body with different kinds of sweetness Some unexpected notes smoke gummy bears are also in the mix but everything fits in seamlessly I‘d definitely locate this one somewhere close to Heady Topper and Pliny the Elder Great beer that once again demonstrates the versatility of Hill Farmstead brewing high quality stuff from different styles",0.023312620206007845
393,Abner,"Draft at Armsby Abbey

Well damn my first Hill Farmstead beer and it’s the 35th highest rated beer on BA I know they’re more known for their Saisons but I’m very happy to try this

Pours a hazy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing

For the style this isn’t super juicy in the nose I’m picking up on aromas of the overripe melon lemon zest bready malt light caramel peppery hops fresh grass and grapefruit rind

It’s a little more aggressive in taste but still feels more rustic than juicy and fruity On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest crackery malt tangerine overripe melon weedy hops and light caramel The swallow brings notes of grapefruit zest orange juice bready malt peppery hops fresh grass and light tangerine

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a zesty yet creamy beer Finishes mostly dry and very balanced

Holy shit this is a great beer Super unique for the style and so drinkable especially for the abv I need more",0.0

Double Sunshine pours with a strikingly hazy and golden orange appearance Looking the part of most hazy ale the beer floats a creamy dense meringue of tarnish froth before enticing the nose with a brisk and brazen citrus scent with an herbal perfume of citronella in a ripe roaring and racy tone Deliciously smooth and velvety in its malty upstart the early palate is met with cereal honey caramel and cream

As the malts settle on the palate the hops simply begin to blossom with a bounty of branchripe Valencia orange tangerine mandarin and blood orange while inviting more fruits of nectarine and mango to add even more racy flavors Red grapefruit tighten its hop taste as a late plunge into juicy notions of sherbet and pushups Trending firmly bitter with smooth pine fragrant woods citrus peel and herbal and a slightly dank vegetal bite

Smell Big maple and oatmeal with a hint of cinnamon smokey bacon and a hint of coffee Hints of chocolate oak and bourbon

Taste Immediately big maple syrup flavored oatmeal just like what was found in the nose Bacon and meaty smoke integrated nicely with a gentle ashy barrel char in the middle that is quite enjoyable Hint of Dads brand root beer candies and cola Finish has lots of rich bourbon notes and chocolate notes This is complex superbly balanced and flat out really really tasty Easily exceeds my expectations for sure

Overall Finally Pretty excited to get to tick this barrel aged porter thanks to TATURBO This beer is rich without being overly sweet The barrel notes are spot on and it really is hard to find anything wrong in this beer Just the right amount of maple which is a flavor that is easy to overdo The balance is also quite impressive as well Put this beer on your must try list if you havent Breakfast flavors galore with a splash of bourbon and oak Whats not to like The barrel aging definitely improves maple bacon coffee porter which is a hard feat to achieve Nice work here from Funky Buddha for sure",0.11213239438420099

Taste follows the nose and is very much dominated by the maple syrup flavor but the surprising part is that it is not at all as sweet as I remember from having this in the past There is much more roasted malt chocolate smoked malts with some slight meaty notes and the bourbon barrel comes through more strongly Some slight roasty bitterness comes through on the back end Feel is thick full bodied and luscious Moderate carbonation Sort of drier on the finish",0.11441551070947106

Review 1100 I figured I’d bust out a special bottle for the occasion and what’s better than the highest rated Gueuze on BA Well Gueuzeinspired I should say based on recent thread Whatever the fuck we wanna call it I’m beyond excited to try this so let’s get into it

After a long and annoying struggle with the double cork breaking inside the bottle it pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Wow this is super bright in the nose just an absolute punch of funk Im picking up on aromas of lemon juice sharp oak old leather wet hay vinegar apple skin dried apricot tart white wine surprising given the red wine barrel aging and general floral notes Really all over the place but fantastic

While its not as incredible in taste it is still very damn good just less sharp than youd expect based on the aroma On the front end of the sip Im tasting wet hay lemon zest jammy apricot white wine vinegar pear white pepper dry oak and light leather The swallow brings notes of bright white wine stone lemon yogurt orange juice apple skin straw and light honey

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a crisp and zesty beer Finishes very dry with a balanced tartness

Super annoying cork aside this is a fantastic treat of a beer Theres something special about this one doing a very convincing Belgian impersonation in the most flattering way I need to get more to cellar cheers BA",0.0

750ml corked and caged bittle  poured into a RieslingZinfandel stem at 45°F

Pours a slightly foggy translucent honeygolden really verging on orange like a West Coast IPA A finger of coarse sticky sudsy offwhite head forms with fair retention and settling to a decent collar with weak spotty lacing Clings to the glass like whiskey Really a beautiful beer

Nose This one travels No shortage of funk here Tons of damp hay and winesoaked oak with plenty of bright lemon juice and rind Theres ample leather book binding dusty stone cellar petrichor magnolia blossom and a really dense note of patchouli with some sweet apricot and marmalade threadinf through Some funky stable sea shell minerality and sweaty brett emerge but the funk is balanced by plenty of bright fruitiness Huge nod to Cantillon here

Palate Duck Duck Gooze emerges with an impressively balanced acidity Like biting into a ripe stone fruit theres a bright POP of tartness but it immediately steps back becoming more of a lemony tang Lemon oil orange juice apricot and crabapple lend bright fruity notes with undertones of cabernet grape cranberry unripe plum and coriander seed The tartness begins to rapidly subside showing quite a bit of grain  dusty with hulls An almost Gueuze level of funk presents itself in the form of wet hay damp wood old musty stable air milkweed and a touch of herbal flowery notes with just a whisper of sweaty funk The tartness completely disappears and the finish shows wheaty grain grass lemon essence white oak and just a touch of grapefruit oil that clings to the palate

MouthfeelBody Absolutely stunning Its crisp airy and quenchingly dry with a shimmering minerality but theres definitely some soft body which lends presence The effervescence is truly perfect Champagne Zippy airy fluffy and fizzy but soft and supple An oily feel lingers

Overall This is perhaps the most stunning American wild ale Ive had in a long time perhaps ever Im not sure if this is Method Traditionelle or not but either way this really is a masterpiece A sweet grain presence incredibly balanced acidity ample funk contrasting against beautiful bright fruity notes and it all comes together so seamlessly and flawlessly this has truly transcended the style itself Simply stunning",0.0235538748575354

In the glass the beer presents a burnt muddy brown pushing towards overripe bruised plum in colour Theres a thin offwhite head 

The aroma is dark cherries brown sugar plum red fruits dark cherry and Christmas cake 

The taste is complex and everchanging There are dark fruits red fruits brown sugar and booze at first and as the beer warms it moves to liqueur cough syrup sweet licorice and dark Christmas cake with the booze backing off There is almost certainly more peeking through but everything intermingles so well together its hard to identify specific notes in the overall melange

The mouthfeel is full and smooth

Overall theres a reason this is so sought after Its my secondhighestrated beer on Untappd behind KBS and without looking I suspect it will be my highest on BA Its also the most expensive beer Ive ever bought coming in at around 55AUD for a 330ml bottle which is about 48 more than an average beer Nevertheless its grabbed without hesitation every time I see it

Aroma is bready and sweet dryly fruity Dates and figs cinnamon and other spices brown sugarcaramel light tobacco—so many smells intermingle like wafting smoke constantly changing Not strong or powerful just wonderfully complex and deep 

Taste is likewise sweet and sugary with so many layers of flavor to pick apart Brown sugar rumsoaked dates figs and prunes candi sugar warm yeasty bread smoky leatherpipe tobacco Just a touch of warming alcohol as it goes down—given the high ABV it’s well hidden 

Mouthfeel is wonderfully deep and full with gently prickly carbonation that allows the beer to dance on the palate without ever getting heavy or syrupy Finishes semidry and clean Just right

While I didnt want to admit it simply due to the ridiculous secondary price this certainly is one of the finest Quads that Ive ever had I still dont think that its worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and bodymouthfeel The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here with a very rich estery character body and mouthfeel Overall this makes for a very rich and wellbalanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price but still stands on its own incredibly well with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all I think that its the richness smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings but from a valueformoney standpoint Id still rather have a Rochefort 10",0.07301020754057112

APPEARANCE pours a dark brown color with two fingers tan head that slowly dissipated until only a ring of small bubbles remained around the rim of glass I swirled the bottle before final pour so there are larger bits of sediment that fell to bottom of glass surprisingly the beer is not highly carbonated its not flat but maybe less than average carbonation there is light lacing on the glass

SMELL dark fruits like fig and raisin there is some black licorice and chocolate bread the 102 alcohol is clearly present

TASTE the taste follows the nose initially bread figs and raisins black licorice and chocolate the alcohol is also present less sweet than some other beers in this style

PALATE lower carbonation gave this a more creamy mouthfeel

OVERALL to me this is not the best beer in the world its not even the best Quad its a good beer dont misunderstand I enjoyed this beer immensely and would be pleased to have it again if Im ever in Belgium but I will never pay 22870 USD to drink this again I can think of two Quads I like better Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus and they are way more affordable my opinion is that the scarcity and high cost of this beer has created an undeserved amount of hype and influenced people to score it higher that it deserves I do not regret buying this beer I can always make more money I would recommend to anyone in Belgium but would not recommend anyone pay 22870 to obtain this good not great beer

Look 35 Smell 375 Taste 4 Feel 350 Overall 4

APPEARANCE pours a dark brown color with very little head that dissipated quickly until there was no head remaining I swirled the bottle on the last pour there was very little sediment in the bottom lower carbonation but its still present after almost 11 years no lacing on the glass

SMELL initially sweet brown sugar and an earthy note of figs and raisins I cant perceive the alcohol at all not as complex on the nose as a more recent bottle

TASTE the taste follows the nose initially sweet brown sugar the earthy note is dominant but there are figs and raisins less complex than a more recent bottle

PALATE  very low carbonation and creamy mouthfeel

OVERALL I would not recommend aging any beer as long as 11 years the biggest issue is carbonation will begin to fail the complexity is degraded the alcohol was less noticeable but the pleasant aspects of the taste are diminished as well I would not recommend aging I know you can but its not as good I would drink this beer as soon as possible",0.06107938081473291

514,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),Even looking at the no label bottle with the engraved circle is somewhat imposing This one had rested for about 5 years It poured a dark plum to prune color with still a good level of carbonation The aroma was wonderful stone fruit The complex character was true to form as still to me the best beer in the world It made the perfect Thanksgiving beer and made me appreciate the good things in the world Cheers,0.03663716527236558
515,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Thanks to Coronaeus for this probably my biggest Want ever This 330ml bottle part of a limited labeled North American release a few years ago had a best before date that I couldnt read Poured into 12oz tulip Poured the expected and anticipated very deep chestnut of the style with about a halfinch tan head that dissipated at a moderate pace and left no lacing

The aroma had all the big stone fruit scents one expects solid earthy grains and a touch of yeast spice and esters Maybe just maybe a touch of alcohol heat as well

On the tongue all those aspects were apparent just amplified The fruitiness was bolder the malts stronger the yeast had more bite and there was certainly a bit of alcohol heat at the back end

The body while full was a bit lighter than I was expecting making the beer float over the palate rather than flooding it The finish wasnt nearly as sweet as I would have thought and dried out quickly

Drinkability was awesome you could easily drink a couple of these without getting bored

Overall a truly great beer worthy of all its multitude of praises A must try for any beer lover",0.01898315991504998

Outstanding appearance The beer poured a nearly opaque pale straw yellow hue and was topped by a frothy fingertall bright white crown that slowly dropped to a lasting film A wall of streaky drippy lacing blanketed the glass and stuck until the drink’s end

The aroma was fantastically hoppy and bright Peach and apricot notes came through big time Loads of juicy citrus as well Orange and orange peel notes were most apparent Good dose of mango too Honeydew melon was also detectable along with the signature Tree House bubble gumlike yeast character Some alcohol appeared as the beer sat

The flavor profile was nearly as stellar as the nose Juicy citrus notes dominated on the front end Like in the aroma orange and orange peel were noticeable Peach and apricot appeared as the beer moved along the palate Some honeydew melon too Pithy orange rind notes came through again on the back end and in the finish Moderate amount of lingering bitterness

The mouthfeel was super soft and supple Medium bodied for the style The liquid contained a finely beaded ultra mellow effervescence that worked nicely

580,Ann,"My long time white whale we meet at last

As we slowly worked through a collection of Hill bottles this evening we started with shelf bottles and transitioned into sacrificing a few wine barrel aged versions The progression is beautifully subtle while the difference in appearance between them is pretty stark Ann has much less visible carbonation than Anna with only a short bubbly collar on top of a shimmering clear burnt amber body This has closer to a honey appearance whereas Anna is a hazier paler yellow with a larger fluffier white head

The aging process has cleaned her up quite a bit more than I was expecting delivering a delicate experience that is less funky yet more woody White grape riesling wine and even notes of buttery chardonney develop as it finishes just barely dry falling off the palate quickly Theres a hint of green olive and its only mildly sour with essentially no funkiness at all This is possibly the most winelike experience Ive gotten out of a beer So much so we were contemplating opening a bottle of white wine to compare It even sweetens up over time

Ann is absurdly refined and complex yet exceedingly simple It does not have the body of the other wonderful Farmstead beers and while I love it I think in the long run that slaying a whale such as this puts into perspective just how fantastic the base beer is as well as all the other HF shelfies which are just so supple easy to enjoy and complex in their own right

585,Fuzzy,"A Tangerine pour with fiery hues to apricot The neck films a shade of macaroon cream that’s dismissive per inscription from the preset retention Howbeit an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility as the intervals thermally protract There’s a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course while effervescence becomes a mobilized variance 

S Pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities Illustrated by a bitingly tart eruption that’s tamed enough for the developing – wild yeast – appearances The progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols which quietly idle funk steps Principally satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold Nonetheless acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks There’s elements of solvency thru the open air drafts which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents On the other hand that piece is often stupefied given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops and biscuity malt brackets to stone fruit minerals

T A clean consecutive punchdown stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard Notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of Goldrich apricots and Armking nectarines while briny minerals perimeter Neptune grass In correlation an engine for Eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg while maintaining that peppery attenuation The ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk To that end the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place Aerial attacks begin setting in from oak dragged elasticities and prompt in some leathery satchels Whilst Chardonnay attenuates a staleness for Budapestlängd with an oxidative nuttiness

M Does not puncture with puckered acridity but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids Namely a backend for rustic brettanomyces and a pillar for biscuity grains The approach is brisk in carbonation as the approach is crisp in sensation Thus cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites but pleasingly uplifting in the dry – erosional – reliefs

O Showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence that’s costly to the preliminary entwines of wild yeast Though development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities and make rational moves In this situation light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols The approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely drycrisp exhibition",0.0

Blend 4 aka Vintage 2020

A Pops and is a gusher which is inexcusable as this has sat undisturbed for months Several ounces wasted and sedimentation disturbed from the bottom Color is apricot yelloworange with a fizzy white head that dissipates almost instantaneously Once that’s gone it actually looks flat It’s quite hazy nearly opaque Certainly not much of a looker 

S Aroma is a great balance of fruit sweetness and tart sour characters Huge fruit flesh characters with big peach as expected but also tangerine and apricot Lactic acidity and sour citrus to balance I would say the tartsour characters are moderate on the nose A bit of melting plastic like funk and mineral notes round it out 

T Taste is very delicious Much more sour than the nose with huge puckering tartness Wonderful sweet fruit notes to balance it’s very orangefamily fruit forward with notes of oranges tangerines nectarines Peace is primarily on the finish but is quite nice Pretty big lemon tartness as well Really fantastic 

MD Mouthfeel is fuller bodied carbonation is appropriately high even though it looks flat in the glass drinkability is very good

O Overall this is an excellent beer no doubt Although 37 overall rating on BA seems damn high Fair or not I always compare these American Wild Ales to traditional Lambics and even very well done ones such as this tend to lack the depth and complexities of most offerings from the likes of 3F and Cantillon Regardless still a treat and would happily drink any day of the week 

Happy New Year BA’s

593,Fuzzy,"Beautiful looking beer pungent aromas of fuzzy peach skin underripe white peach flesh lemony acidity and a hint of peach rings and oak the nose on this is really wonderful

wish I could say the same about the taste  I feel like this could be used as an effective cleaning product there is definitely a robust and complex peach flavor that is very impressive but the overwhelming dryness and acidity detracts from that and probably drowns out some of the more subtle complexity getting some grainy character and hints of vinegar white grape and vanilla dont get me wrong I still enjoyed this beer but it was sour and acidic to the point of almost being harsh  I tend to prefer more subtle and delicate examples of the style As I finished the bottle I thought well this was good but I would have been fine with 8oz which is something I have never said after drinking a 375mL of world class fruited mixed ferm",0.0

595,Fuzzy,"Review 500 Side Project  Fuzzy 

Batch 4 2020 375ml  poured into a tulip at 42°F

Pours a moderately foggy sunglow orange not dissimilar to the peach on the label A thin coarse broken offwhite head almost forms before quickly falling leaving only a razorthin collar and constant streams of effervescence 425

Nose Signature Side Project pale base with evident crackery grains a touch of malt and some dusty silo The peaches are restrained  apparent but not loud lending a very organic white peach aroma much like nectarine The acidity translates as fresh lemon juice and just a splash of apple cider vinegar  tame and bright There is a ton of wet white oak  woody and musty playing with some funky wet hay raw honey stone cellar dusty attic leather parchment honeysuckle lilac dried leaves and peach blossoms Not aggressive funky or tart

Palate Fuzzy greets the palate with a quick flash of tartness  lactic and acetic in nature lending some lemon juice and apple cider vinegar The peaches once more are very natural and ripe but not jammy These are fruity bright white peaches with most of their fructose fermented out Huge stone fruit notes of peach nectarine apricot and a big plum presence Remarkably floral with honeysuckle lilac gardenia and even a hint of honeydew melon As the acidity curves oak begins to show along with a hint of sweet grain which adds nice balance Some farmhouse notes of hay wet wet stone and earth emerge providing that true wild touch with the brett adding a nice dusty sweaty overripe element It finishes remarkably clean with a general stone fruit presence behind a fading acidity some subtle grain and drying wet white oak with nothing really lingering

MouthfeelBody Its incredible how Side Project can produce these 8 ABV wild ales with such clean crisp snappy fluidity Fuzzy is lightbodied with no real malt weight and quite dry with no significant residual sugars Perhaps a touch less sparkling than champagne but with a similar feel  airy clean bright and snappy Acidity is tart  sour even but definitely shy of puckering The finish has some nice drying tannic oak Ultraclean

Overall Fuzzy is a bottle with a lofty reputation Long considered one of the finest fruited wild ales Thats a tall order Is it the greatest wild ale Ive ever had I wouldnt say so Is it the greatest peach sour Ive ever had Most likely What it most certainly is is the definition of Side Project Yes it is one of the more sour offerings using their high acid blonde base but it isnt overbearing and its one of the more subtle offerings  beautifully showcases the delicate nuance and balance that theyre so great at The tartness the minerality the organic nature of the fruit the oak the gentle funk all meticulously blended It really is a worldclass wild ale and one everyone should try at some point",0.009262833572945474

Alright folks here we are the final BIF beer I received from Eziel It’s been a wild 6 months of hard to find beers and we’re ending with the heaviest hitter of the bunch This is currently the 5th highest rated Saison on BA and 52nd overall Those are some impressive stats Also I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen a beer fruited with only nectarine it’s usually a blend Let’s get into it

Pours an opaque orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that very quickly fizzes away to nothing and leaves no lacing

Sheesh less than stellar appearance aside this is bold in the nose just super fruity and tart with a big funk too Im picking up on aromas of sweet nectarine wet hay tart apricot sharp oak lemon yogurt wildflower honey straw and crackery malt

Oh man the funk is even punchier in taste but not in a way thats out of balance On the front end of the sip Im tasting tart peach lemon juice white wine vinegar stone sharp oak nectarine wet hay honey and lemongrass The swallow brings notes of wet hay stone white wine vinegar peach pit nectarine sharp oak crackery malt lemon yogurt and light orange juice

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a sharp and zippy beer Finishes bone dry with a lovely balance of sour fruit and funk

601,Nectarine Premiere,this one has been on my most wanted list for awhile so huge thanks to my boy for scoring this for us to share what a gem its as good as i hoped it would be the nectarine popping in here natural and juicy the essence of the fruit as so many de garde beers deliver and it seems right in its peak bottle from september 2020 pale brew with some haze through most of the bottle very fizzy but not holding a ton of head and a nose that my mouth is still watering from wow its puckery nectarous and juicy ripe and sweet and sour at the same time wood heavy fully wild incredible aroma here and it gets better as it warms more fruit more funk more wood the flavor is fantastic the fruit hits mostly at the end its mature vinous funky wild beer up front slightly raw on the grain side maybe some unmalted wheat in here pils malt doughy and crackery and simple but earthy the ferment is sharp but not overly sour tannic from the oak maybe some white wine character too lots of well developed bretty funk too when the fruit hits its like taking a bite of a ripe nectarine and it stays on the tongue through the finish impressively real forward and its crazy this is as dry as it is because the fruit is so sweet amazing this has already developed well in the bottle but i think its safe to say even more time would evolve it further its maybe not as complex on the yeast side as my favorite de garde beers but the fruit element is as good as it gets great carbonation here too lively and excited feeling on the palate fits the summery fruitiness loved this very thankful i know this is one of their highest rated beers but its probably not even in my top five from them amazing as it is,0.02293403053845938

Bottled 1242021 poured straight from the fridge into a frosted glass Started around 48° and it was very closed up Still able to get all the main notes of coffee dark chocolate and bourbon but they were nowhere near as strong until the beer warmed up My favorite temp was about 5560° but I sipped until it hit closer to 70°

Overall Incredible stout Loads of separate flavors that all come together perfectly 

L pitch black color can’t even see light coming through when held up to a lamp Toasted brown head with good retention and lacing from top to bottom 

S at first I got more chocolate than anything else but as the beer warmed up 510° I got a much darker chocolate and strong coffee notes followed by bourbon on the end Chocolate heavy overall 

Tcold straight from the fridge at 48° I got some coffee and chocolate and maybe some black licorice with a heavy hit of alcohol at the end As the beer warmed up the alcohol completely disappeared Strong coffee flavor followed by dark chocolate and some nice bitterness that you would get from a nice piece of dark chocolate Bourbon follows on the aftertaste Slightly sweet at first with a bitter ending Some roasted malt but coffee and chocolate are by far the strongest notes

S  The roasted coffee comes up front with a slight hint of chocolate Not much else Its pretty much straightup coffee smell

T  The coffee roast comes up front then fades to a chocolate There’s a little bit of cola flavor there too The flavor is then balanced with a slight bourbon at the end Aftertaste is a mild coffee roast Toward the end of the beer though the coffee notes fade a little and the chocolate notes take center stage The taste is much more complex and pleasing than the smell

F  The carbonation is almost like a cola Smooth texture overall Easy to drink 

O  Again I tried this a week after trying Founders Oatmeal Stout From memory they are very similar Not sure about sidebyside comparison As I stated in that previous review I do not like coffee Taste or smell But these were so highly regarded that I had to try them I still don’t prefer the coffee taste but this is still a great beer Very smooth flavors that go together well The 12 alcohol did not make this boozy at all It was all flavor and no sign of high alcohol I personally won’t try this again but for a coffee drinker this would be a fantastic beer

Smell and taste Bourbon of course chocolate tobacco some dried hay some smoke but not a lot and more and more roasted loveliness The alcohol burn is there but it really just transports all of the flavors to the nose and tongue and is not overly intrusive Everything is balanced which is a characteristic of all of my favorite beers Take a sip and contemplate all of the different flavors as they dance across your tongue from start to finish front to back There is a lot of variety here 

Feel As at least one other review mentions for its massive burst of robust intense flavor it is not a thick beer but is surprisingly thin It is not a makeorbreak for the beer just an interesting characteristic 

Overall One of my top 10 beers The old bomber Karbach BBHs La Fin Du Monde Avery Reverend Aventinus Real Ale Sisyphus Avery Maharaja Ranger Creek Wee Heavy any dark ale from Double Mountain in Oregon New Belgium Ranger Imperial IPA

I always drink these out of a Bordeaux style wine glass since it concentrates the scent of the beer I usually pour one right out of the fridge and drink it slowly over an hour or so savoring the considerable shifts in flavor as it warms up The coffee and the chocolate notes become more predominant and the complexity bursts forth The finish also becomes more Aventinus like and will linger on the tongue as long as you want it to There is a strange stage about 20 minutes in when a burnt nut bitterness becomes more apparent amongst all of the other flavors But fret not just wait and it will revert back to its full palate

A The look does not disappoint The darkest body with a brief dark brown head which lasts about 10 seconds and I poured generously into a clean clear snifter Love this look even if much of it is to style 45
S Dark fruits predominate without too much “heat” of alcohol which I expected somewhat due to the high ABV I certainly pick up some deep sweet bourbon notes but the dark fruits are front and center Intriguing and I give it “extra credit” for not being too “hot” 45
T Wow So much going on here Early taste is a LOT of dark fruits heat of alcohol bourbon notes dancing on my tongue and then dissipating into a long slow alcohol slide out to an amazing finish of smooth dark roast malt but that process takes about 2 minutes 45
M Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for the style and the beer’s reputation Mind you this is NOT a thin beer just that I had expected one of the fullest thickest beers but it is not 35
D DrinkabilityOverall Overall a fantastic beer one that everyone reading this should seek out Drinkability is limited by your budget and your sobriety but this is a “night capper” kind of beer Only a fool would drink several of these in one evening Intention in my opinion is to enjoy one of these in an evening and frankly share it with someone else 40",0.10077420510481723

646,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"This is my first review on BeerAdvocate

Pouring this from a 169 oz bottle the pour produces a nice finger or so of tan head that dissipates after a few minutes A bit of lace is left around the edge with light head left bubbling in the middle Overall a very dark nearly black pour gives off a strong boozy scent not uncommon in barrelaged stouts The aroma is also quite sweet which for me is always a good sign of a stout with a good body and careful construction So far so good

The first taste is very very heavy on the tongue This is an Imperial Stout with a lot going on It sticks to the inside of your mouth like a stout should and has a sweethot initial hit likely thanks to the very high ABV of 14 There is a certain candy flavor up front that I am not a huge fan of but it doesnt stay around for long Afterward the taste dissolves into almost a colalike flavor that lingers for a long time It feels like there are a ton of flavors including coffee and dried fruit that almost overwhelm anything else 

This is a fine beer It isnt my favorite stout of all time but it is an American Imperial Stout and is amongst the most wellcrafted I have ever had I can see this being someones gotoo Stout when its in season but the flavor profile is just a little too sweet for me

It is a clear reddish plum pour with half a finger of pure white head It looks less thick than many of the HF saisons I have tried but prettier

All the flavors of the nose are here no need to repeat them balanced perfectly in a wonderful blend It ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a tart fruity linger As it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix quite lightly and it gets even better

375ml bottle  2018 vintage  poured into a wide tulip at 44°F 

Pours a clear yet eversoslightly foggy true gold hue with all but a loose ring of white foam forming that sticks around permanently Some lazy effervescence is visible 

Nose In classic Hill Farmstead form the aroma is beautifully delicate and fragile beginning with subtle notes of malt and wheat with a rustic sort of grainy note about it Atop this gentle acidity and beautiful minerality act as a conduit for a melange of bright vinous fruits in the form of lemon pear apple nectarine white grape and gooseberry and then this subtle yet spectacular dark fruit note that is quietly jammy sweet and plummet almost evoking a hint of grape juice and grape pixie stix Finally threads of oak hay grass attic leather parchment wet moss and petrichor stitch it a together Absolutely spectacular 

Palate Immediately the defining notes of the base beer  Florence are beautifully showcased here rounded by maturity She greets the palate with the most restrained acidity with a hint of lemonlime and then that unique floral fresh coriandereucalyptus note peaks through Bright fresh fruity notes of pear gooseberry white wine grape underripe plum and tart plum skins all play together surrounded by a racey vibrant minerality that sparkles over the palate There is a subtle thread of funk lending damp earth moss hay wet oak white grape pomace river stones and a whisper if dusty brett before the lemonlime and exotic fruity floral notes resurface A slight mintycamphoraceous element cools the palate and then the oak comes in to dry out the fruity bits Flora Plum finishes dry and clean with a faint hint of grain and zero acidity 

MouthfeelBody Delicate light and crisp yet managing to avoid being watery or lacking in any way Perfect gentle acidity which is complimented by a zippy sparkling minerality and lively but delicate effervescence Perfectly dry with just a hint of fruity sweetness and plumskin tartness Subtle drying oak and as clean as you could imagine 

Overall This is a truly spectacular farmhouse ale I thought blueberry was divine yet I believe this exceeds it  and Im a sucker for blueberry Its just so delicate elegant and tasteful while truly conveying all the character of Florence softened by oak and time and delivering this subtle but beautiful fruity plum influence Theres a reason this beer is so highly revered Practically flawless and utterly Hill Farmstead",0.01999500187421909

Notes via stream of consciousness A very hazy or rather cloudy golden body rests beneath a massive head of slightly off white foam Its three fingers thick at this point and holding quite well so I may have to wait a minute to take a sip In the nose Im getting plenty of citrus including grapefruit perhaps some orange and some other tropical fruits as well although theyre not quite clear OK the head has settled so let me give it a taste ahhh thats nice its got a nice combination of malt and hop and a firm bitterness to back it I think theres even a little bit of hop burn there The malt is sweetish bready and even lightly honeyish making it a great base for the hops to bounce off of The grapefruit remains but its not the dominant note anymore and Im getting more peach and other tropical fruits Theres some melon a hint of lime mango passionfruit  and lychee I love lychee Its a little weird eating a fruit that kind of feels like an eyeball but when theyre perfectly ripe theyre absolutely delicious Its fairly floral as well mostly coming out in the finish I get a mild alcohol presence How strong is this    Theres nothing on the label Doesnt matter I think its nicely balanced and I am definitely getting some hop burn I could probably drink about ten of these in a row Only kidding but I feel like it has that kind of drinkability Alright let me wrap this up The body is medium on the higher end or at least it appear that way due to all of the extra proteins in it and its gently crisp and then smooth across the palate Ill definitely be looking for more of this Oh I almost forgot although the head has great retention  Im still looking at an eight of an inch of solid surface covering  the lacing falls behind I think it still scores a 425 because the head retention is so good but with a little more lacing it could have hit a 45

We’re nearing the end of the BIF beers I got from Eziel back in February and this one is a heavy hitter This has been a big want for me for a while so it’s awesome to finally be able to try it Let’s see what this famoud spicy Stout is really all about

Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This is highly complex in the nose not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nibs vanilla bean chili pepper spicy whiskey burnt coffee sweet toffee brown sugar and light charred oak

This is a bit restrained in taste perhaps due to the age but I still really enjoy it On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark chocolate roasty coffee chipotle pepper vanilla bean spicy whiskey toasted oak cinnamon and toffee The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate chipotle pepper vanilla bean caramel toasted oak earthy whiskey and burnt coffee

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth and earthy beer Finishes mostly dry with a lingering heat

750ml bottle  poured into a balloon stem at 50°F Huge thanks to DonnieT79 for this longtime want

Pours an unbelievable slick jet black colour  absorbing every photon of light with the single darkest head on a beer that Ive ever seen forming  like a grade school volcano it foams up  fine and sudsy with the colour of light coffee beans and then receding to a huge persistent coarse bubbly collar that lasts forever 475

Nose Incredibly rich Almost like a concentrate Deep bold roasted malts with a particularly Russianstyle accord lend bitter bakers chocolate cacao Peruvian coffee black treacle toffee caramel marzipan and vanilla A slight dense fruity thread lends a deep raisiny PX sherry note with a hint of fig blueberry and dried cherry Im failing to pick up any chilies or cinnamon but there is a unique warm spice element lending a hint of earthiness Not very Mexican but it smells delicious 425

Palate The legendary Hunahpu greets the palate with an expertly dialedin balance between malt sweetness and roast Immediately it lets you know that it is not trying to be a Mexican wedding cake  this is a Russian imperial stout with a bold heavy roast deep dark bitter complexion and leaning drier on the sweetness scale Roasty is the main theme here Bitter cocoa charred malts burned sugar and burned vanilla lead the way with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness The pepper is there if you really squint but rather than lending a chili heat its more of an earthy dry spice Spice as in spices not heat Im not picking up on cinnamon perhaps due to its age but theres definitely some type of spice character thats lending an earthy aromatic quality It grows drier nudging out any sweetness and the charred malt takes hold upping the dry bitter factor The faintest little glow of pepper warmth emerges and the stout concludes with deep bitter roast cacao and an almost tannic bite to it which lingers resurfacing with an espresso like aftertaste 40

MouthfeelBody Despite its foreboding motor oil appearance Hunahpu is quite drinkable A bold rich heavy brew but hes quite fluid with a mediumfull body and very minimal viscosity Theres some fine subtle fizzy effervescence but its relegated to the background and only just contributes enough The chilies warm only the gums and it concludes with a drying tannic roasty squeeze 425

Overall This is a tricky one for me I know this is revered as a legend and was once highly soughtafter and perhaps the age didnt treat this one the best but I have a hard time falling in love with it Its a bit roasty and bitter for my taste and feel it trends more in the classic Russian style than anything else Its a great RIS especially if you like them bitter and roasty and the hint of pepper is a nice twist but I keepwishing that it were just a touch sweeter less roasty with more carameltoffeevanillamalt and less cacaocharblackened bite I can certainly see how the right person would adore this though I just find the roast a bit overbearing  375",0.03496818795556444

Notes via stream of consciousness A fingers width of offwhite foam tops a murky goldenbrass colored body The head appears to be holding quite well The aroma is fairly mild for an NEIPA but offers up passionfruit nectarine and a light touch of citrus The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of orange pineapple juicy apple and distant lemonlime The malt is basic most likely with 2row wheat and oats although I cant specifically taste the wheat or oats A solid bitterness backs it and it finishes dry with some quickly passing fruit that leaves a soft grassiness bitterness and hop bite lingering In the mouth its medium bodied with a gentle caress on the tongue Its fluffy and smooth with plenty of proteins The head held up really well and its left some very interesting to look at lace all around the glass All in all I dont think that Green is Treehouses best beer by any stretch but its a solid well balanced and highly drinkable beer

Quite frothy quickly dissipating white head Fairly murky medium orange with some amber overtones to the look Mango guava candied tangelo peel a little medium roast caramel malt emerges out of the mix Seems like there is a whiff of some nutmegallspice or such buried deep in the aroma A nice melange of some Mandarin orange peel a bit of medium light toasted malt underlying and a whiff of guavapassion fruit deep in the taste somewhere There is some lightness to this beer and it finishes mainly with a little tingly glowing Mandarin orangetangelo peel bite Definitely well done",0.0

Notes via stream of consciousness A two finger thick head of offwhite rests atop a murky golden body with an orange sheen The aroma isnt as strong as I expected but it delivers some orange and passionfruit over a sweetish and grainy malt base The flavor is bright and vibrant with a clear note of tangerine backed by passionfruit nectarine apricot and mango The malt is delicately sweetish bready and lightly oatlike The bitterness is moderate and yet it finishes dry due at least in part to some hop acidity In the mouth its medium bodied but it feels a little fuller due to all of the extra proteins giving it a fluffy feel Its smooth but that hop burn gives it a little bit of an edge The head has held up really well and Ive still got a creamy but more importanty complete surface covering The lacing covers quite a bit and looks like a drawing of trees out of a book of scary stories The aroma is better on their Very Hazy and Ive scored it better overall but for my money I prefer this easier drinking version

This beer is an imperial version of Alter Ego which is one of their only flagship NEIPAs that I have not tried yet so I cant draw any comparisons there However I have had Doubleganger the extra hopped variant of this and enjoyed it quite a bit

Pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of rocky white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

Herbaceous vibes from the nose translate well into taste but with less intensity allowing for greater balance which bumps up my rating On the front end of the sip Im tasting earthy papaya mango overripe grapefruit light pine and a creamy malt The swallow brings notes of herbal hops creamy malt tangerine and underripe cantaloupe

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a very creamy beer that coats the mouth on the way down Finishes somewhere between dry and slick

Holy shit I’ve finally found a fresh Alchemist drop nearby and I wasn’t even actively looking My local store managed to get some of this and Heady Topper I got a few cans of each HT is ready for a rereview and I couldn’t be more psyched on it Let’s see what this legendary beer is all about

Pours a hazy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

This is super juicy in the nose but also shows and incredible balance I’m picking up on aromas of orange zest bready malt mango juice peppery hops pithy grapefruit cantaloupe pineapple juice and light weed

While it’s very good in taste it doesn’t carry that same balance displayed in the aroma On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe mango orange zest doughy malt lemon zest grassy hops and light pineapple The swallow brings notes of orange zest bready malt caramel pineapple juice grapefruit zest peppery hops and light weed

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a creamy yet crisp beer Finishes mostly dry with with a nice blend of fruit juice and weed

907,Focal Banger,Would argue that this is in fact better than Heady Topper The tropical nature and just dankness of the hops shines through even more Where Heady Topper feels like I’m drinking hop resin Focal Banger feels like I’m drinking fruit juice with a tinge of hops,0.0

I was given this beer by one of my good friends I have already consumed a few they are tasty Served in a tulip glass at around 44 degrees The pour created a frothy and creamy twofingered head with aboveaverage retention The head is bright white leaving gobs of lacing on the glass The color is pale straw with hues of light gold charting beer around SRM 4 This beer is hazy and little yeasty friends are just floating around The appearance of the beer is above average 
Tangerines lightly floral with hints of pineapple pears and peaches are the hops aromas The malt profile is lightly toasted bread crust cereal grains and a touch of crackers Other aromas are grass wet dew and yeasty 
The hop profile is the star of this beer The hops flavors I taste are tangerine a hint of pine a touch of orange peel pineapple mango pears some floral and a touch of passionfruit The malt body is light yet stiff enough to hold the hops in check Other flavors I detect are lightly toasted bread crust crackers a hint of minerals a touch phenolic and grassy 
The mouthfeel is dry and crisp with medium carbonation The body is medium and it finishes tannic and long

Aroma features flaky malts introducing a softer pineapple into mango flesh and a resinous grapefruit interlude sparking a peaking bouquet whereon transitional pine to freshcut grass on the back end remains synchronized to a peppery dank lemon twist

Taste opens to pineapple resins with a light tinge of tangerine pith wrapped in an undertone of freshly sliced mango laden with grassy hop textures a grapefruit twang over the midpalate phases effortlessly into a lemony dank finish with flaky malt accents and distant hints of pine

Mouthfeel offers a medium body with a fluffy moderatehigh carbonation a wispy twang invigorates a vague bitterness over the midpalate trending sticky as pillowy resins take hold into the back end for a lush hop consistency and a flaky crispness persists with drying undertones through the finish

It is sweet in taste but not in any cloying way rather it is kept wonderfully in check by many complex notes On the front end of the sip Im tasting milk chocolate plum vanilla sweet bourbon toasted oak coconut black cherry and burnt caramel The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder boozy bourbon vanilla brown sugar molasses black cherry pecan toasted oak and dark roast coffee

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick and sweet beer Finishes sticky and heavy but not overwhelmingly sweet

968,Truth,"750 ml bottle

Gentle pour brings a pure jet black motor oil color with a finger of caramel head Good retention for the style Leaves a halo of lacing around the glass Settles into a thin film laid carefully across the beer

The aroma brings strong notes of bourbon dark fruits caramel dark chocolate and pecans with loads of vanilla oak toffee dark roast coffee beans light char and a bit of smoke

The flavor has tons of chocolate fudge and chocolate chip cookies Theres loads of Hazelnut coffee toasted pecans and almonds as well as bourbon vanilla oak fig plum and caramel Boozy but at 123 this should be expected A lot going on here but it all works perfectly together

The feel is full bodied chewy and syrupy Almost no carbonation but plenty of booze as expected

Overall I might be a Tree House fanboy but Ive been quite critical of their stouts in recent years Theyve become a bit too sweet with minimal balance Just chocolate syrup This bad boy however is one of the rare barrel aged stouts they have Fortunately I didnt pay anything for the beer as the bottle was shared with a friend

This is definitely one of the best beers Ive ever had The bourbon is certainly present but doesnt overpower the beer like other BA stouts Its sweet but nowhere near cloying Boozy but not overly so",0.24482409587393414

Medium bodied dark brownblack appearance Somewhat thinner in appearance and lighter in color than I anticipated The beer was topped by a small cap of bubbly cappuccino colored froth that quickly broke apart A medium sized halo encircled the liquid

The aroma was solid initially but somewhat subtle Malty notes dominated Roasted malts were most apparent Good dose of caramel malt character too Moderately sweet Slightly smoky Almost a touch peaty Dark fruits were also detectable Raisins plums and figs perhaps There was a bit of a papery oxidative quality as well but this subsided with time As the beer sat the aroma intensified The dark fruits the sweetness and the smoke became notably punchier

The flavor profile followed the nose Rich and malty up front but less intense than anticipated Nice melding of roasted and caramel malts Slightly smoky Boozy notes kicked in as the beer moved along the palate Port soaked raisins came to mind There was a bit of a chocolateTootsie Rolllike character too Subtle metallic notes appeared on the back end but they dissipated with time More lingering booze and sweetness on the finish

The mouthfeel was solid but thinner bodied for a beer of this magnitude Smooth and slick on the palate The liquid contained a fine moderate effervescence that fluffed up nicely on the palate

Tree House make some amazing adjuncted milk stouts but their purely barrelaged releases seem to be a bit lacking in intensity and mouthfeel While this was an enjoyable beer it did little to stand apart from the pack",0.045617155276182327

750ml bottle  blend 5  poured into a chalice at 50°F 

Pours a clear deep strawgolden hue with just a cast of unfiltered fog and a finger of creamy soft offwhite head eventually settling to a thick collar leaving some lacing behind Visible effervescence

Nose Soft pale rustic grains with crackery wheat and some round malted barley lend secondary notes of wet hay dewy grass and some dusty silo There is some remarkable floral character lending spring blossoms like lilac and hyacinth with lemon blossom wet stony minerality and a lightly musty oakiness Some very restrained white vinous notes along with a touch of pear apple and apricot Gentle hints of honey lemon zest and some phenolic peppery notes wrap it all up in a beautifully soft and rustic olfactory display

Palate Saison du Fermier greets the palate with simultaneous waves of gentle lemony tang semisweet grist with some crackery bready and rustic grainy notes and an explosion of bright shimmery fruity notes Lemon nectarine apricot tart white plum green apple Asian pear and a sweettart balance of fruity white grape Theres a bright but balanced minerality pushing these flavours to the front along with some wet limestone Some Belgianlike saison yeast brings that fruity undertone with a bit of peppery spice intermingling with a touch of herbal hops Finish is oaky dry and lightly tannic

MouthfeelBody Its on the lighter side of mediumbodied with a tight snappy crispness  bright and fluid but theres enough grain to lend some softness and presence Effervescence is incredibly lively and fizzy but fine enough to stay soft and fluffy Tart and wet up front finishing with an increasingly dryness and a touch of cling

Pours pitch black with a finger of fizzy dark mocha almost reddish head that fizzes away almost instantly When swirled it coats the glass with a dark film

Aroma is light coconut and even lighter vanilla as expected from the extended aging This allows the base stout and barrel to shine more Dark chocolate black cherry tobacco roasted malt some peat and molasses from the base and some charred oak and bourbon from the barrel

Taste brings more of the adjuncts than expected given the aroma but theyre still quite light given todays pastry stout standards Toasted coconut and light vanilla bean dance in the background while the barrel treated stout is at the forefront Bakers chocolate some bittersweet chocolate chip roasted malt some peat tobacco black cherry some fig molasses some brown sugar charred oak bourbon spirit Im sure theres some vanillin and even possibly some coconut coming from the barrel but its hard to tell if that character is from the adjuncts or the barrel

Medium to high medium body Slick oily sticky warming Could use a bit more body Doesnt drink like 16 but you know youre drinking a big beer

I know I shouldnt have sat on this as long as I did because Im sure there was a lot more coconut and vanilla character however the base and barrel integration are top notch and allowing the adjuncts to subside has shown this It also has led to what Id imagine is a smoother drinking experience than when it was fresher Im sure a fresher version of this would meet my expectations more but this is still a very enjoyable beer at where its currently at",0.1

Pours a nearly pitchblack color Befitting a huge barrelaged monster there isnt much head just a tan collar topping it off 

The aroma though is out of this world good The focus here is on roasted malt espresso licorice and bakers cocoa A light touch of smoke gives it another layer of depth Theres a tiny hint of cinnamon lingering around which is good too much cinnamon would have hurt its chances at greatness And of course the assertive bourbon barrels cant be overlooked Tons of oak vanilla and bit of corn shine through 

While the taste doesnt follow the nose superclose its wonderful in its own way It starts off with a nice sweet cinnamon flavor lacking the bitter spice of other frankly lesser cinnamonadorned beers Same with the bourbony finish its subtle yet noticeable without being massively assertive Dark chocolate espresso roast and licorice round out the middle  again enough to make you think but not enough to overpower Theres a ton of stuff going on with this one and actually coalesces together into something harmonious and complex instead of complicated and sloppy The more I consume the more I love it therefore it earns an elusive 5 tastewise 

Its not as texturally slick or slimy as other big oatmeal stouts but by no means is it bonedry I could use a touch more body and thickness but thats me nitpicking for the sake of picking nits Its still as creamy and decadent as one could want from a monster barrelaged stout Carbonation is low but it doesnt need much anyways since the oak tannins cleanse the palate decently 

Im always that guy saying beer X doesnt live up to the hype or wondering how the hell beer Y earned a 100 This though this lives up to the hype and then some Its one of the most complex stouts Ive ever sampled and  like I said  isnt complex in a some is good therefore too much is even better kind of way Its wonderfully cohesive and wellrounded in a way stouts not even a fourth as deep are An absolute masterpiece seek it out yesterday",0.037977726265637494

The aroma on this beer is complex and enticing there is some dark chocolate and a bit of roasted malts and almost charred note I also definitely get cinnamon but its not artificial like Big Red very earthy cinnamon note Also some bourbon notes come through here I dont get licorice that is on the label which is okay as I dont tend to like anicelicorice aroma or flavor too much I dont get any booze here which is impressive at 133 Also not much if anything for a hop profile on the nose

First sip reveals a full thick body with soft gentle and fine carbonation Beer feels nice on my palate and does give a bit of a coating on my lips with each sip
Flavor follows the notes advertised on the nose I get dark chocolate and some bourbon with hints of dark chocolate rolling through Some warming and earthy cinnamon pops up and this flavor lingers along with a bit of warmth or is THAT the abv which was hidden on the nose Not really any char or heavy roast notes here The bourbon does come back very dominant on the burps Hops we dont need no stinkin hops I dont get any on the flavor profile

This one pours a very dark black color with a small head and no lacing

This smells like charred oak lots of bourbon lots of vinous grape character brandy roasted malt dark fruit

This is a nice bridge between some of overtly wine based Black Tuesday variants and the regular bourbon Black Tuesday The grape brandy adds a pleasantly oaky vinous character sweet but finishes dry with oaky char marshmallow dark chocolate caramel roast and bourbon

This is medium bodied slightly thin as most Black Tuesday variants tend to be with a lots of concentrated booziness It’s not overwhelmingly boozy but it really kind of does drink like a distilled stout liqueur

1025,Black Tuesday - Reserve,"Review 8000 2015 vintage This will be a very emotional review Normally for big milestones like this rudzud would have some crazy beer to share but that cant happen now Instead this was one from our share box that we got from Hoarders saving for a special day He might not be here physically to share it with me but hes here in spirit

Pours basically with no head whisp of fizzy bubbles disappears almost instantly dark murky molasses brown color with no real light coming through and legs for days

Nose brings lots of barrel and bourbon lots of vanilla oak a bit buttery oak fresh bourbon barrel juice a bit like my nose in a Glencairn glass with some decent bourbon lots of dark malts under that some roast and coffee no char loads of cocoa dark chocolate a little nougat candy bar fudge a bit of a chocolate syrup as well a little alcohol

Taste super rich heavy malts and barrel dark chocolate raw cocoa chocolate syrupy again a bit of a candy bar with light nougat and caramel notes some roast and coffee as well more like a coffee syrup barrel brings lots of vanilla again and fresh bourbon barrel juice a little generic whiskey character but some raw sweet bourbon as well getting fudgey in the middle some toasted oak character and layers of vanilla a touch of baking spice med lighter bitterness mostly from the roasted malts some hot alcohol not quite fusel but almost there finishes sticky and coats the mouth never really goes away lingering cocoa fudge vanilla and generic whiskey

Mouth is full bod rich syrupy and really coats the mouth some hot tingly alcohol medlight foamy carb

Overall quite nice there have been better Bruery beers but for a Black Tuesday variant adding the extra bourbon and barrel was nice although I think it has dropped a bit from what it probably was fresh but alcohol didnt destroy either as the age probably helped there 

I swear I heard a pop sound from my glass while it was resting and I was typing Matt must have taken his sip and I hope he enjoyed it Miss the great bottle shares and fun times This was just one more milestone in my reviews I know rudzud always joked about how he would never catch me in reviews and I guess he was right Ill keep drinking beers but Ill always have that hole that will never be filled Cheers Matt",0.19564061703457195

I will start my day with a wild ale I have tried most of the sours from RRB they have been phenomenal I used a tulip glass the temperature was 44 degrees The pour created a frothy and airy light tan head with poor retention The quick dissipation left zero lacing on the glass The color charts around SRM 15 dark amber with rusty orange hues The beer is somewhat hazy The appearance of the beer is beautiful 
When I pulled the cork out wine and oak aromas emitted Nosing further in the glass I detect sour apple cider funky barn horse blanket cherries toasted crackers and leather Smelling the beer several times I sense floral ester a touch of phenols and a slight fruity sweetness 
The beers aromas are sharp but did do not relate to the taste The flavors are brett oak vinous sour apple cider horse blanket dankness funky barnyard herbal hay cherries lightly toasted malts leather phenolic and earthiness 
The mouthfeel is astringent tart and dry The body of the beer is mediumlight high carbonation and delightfully long finish

Continuing on with and nearing the end of my run of Russian River Wild Ales we have the 9th highest rated of the style and 104th overall It seems that they’re really leaning heavily into the Americanized Lambic vibe with this one so I’m interested to see if that holds true Let’s find out

Pours a cloudy yellow gold with almost no head just a ring of bubbles that leaves no lacing

Less than stellar looks aside this one smells fantastic I’m picking up on aromas of wet hay white wine vinegar acidic lemon juice sharp oak crackery malt lime zest white pepper leather and musty apple skin

Ok so the aroma was a knockout that had me expecting this to be super tart but it leans into more of a restrained funk in taste On the front end of the sip Im tasting apple skin straw lemon zest old wood white grape and flowers The swallow brings notes of white pepper wet hay old leather apple skin white wine vinegar and light bready malt Really good but pales in comparison to the aroma

A medium body pairs with gentle acidic carbonation resulting in a crisp and funky beer Finishes very dry with a slight tartness

This is good but I suspect that for some reason 2 years on it has mellowed it out far too much Seems odd for a Lambicinspired beer but based on reviews of fresh bottle this seems to have lost its bite Id love to try it fresh one day though",0.0

100 spontaneously fermented beer aged in wine barrels Barrel aged 9 to 36 months thats quite a spread fermented beer using only wild yeast and bacteria 600 ABV

HEAD None reallyjust a floater ring thats rather thin and weak dissipating in under 10 seconds

BODY Also a bit thin and weak and certainly dull with a depleted and dareisay undercarbonated look

I imagine Im going to enjoy this beer but were kidding ourselves if this is a perfect 5 for appearance

AROMA Oak barrelderived vanillin white wine still cidre obvious lactic acid The bacterial aromatics are much more subdued than I imagined theyd be coming inthey register but its not teeming with lactobacillus like so many American brewed sour ales Im looking at you Cascade Brewing Doesnt seem as full of life and bacteriaridden as say Allagashs coolship ales but its enticing with promises of ample barrel character microfloral intricacy and diverse bacteria

I dont get any of that wet cardboard character one sometimes finds in wellmeaning sour ales and I find no signs of infection Some green apple sure suggesting perhaps acetobacter No vomitredolent aromatics that would indicate butyric acid are present

Aromatic intensity is average for the style maybe even a bit on the timid side Doesnt scream acidity but it does seem acidic judging by the aroma

TASTE amp TEXTURE Zaps with mellow acidity and puckering yet mellow bacteria hitting on all fronts pediococcus brettanomyces yeast and lactobacillus Not a lactobomb yielding to the lactobacillus without letting it dominate the beers flavour profile

I cant shake the feeling this would be better fruited Some source of added sweetness would help counter its dry acidity this lacks the tartness that often accompanies sourness and I think its worse for it

Smooth smacky deliberately undercarbonated and to good effect I might add evoking a fine Brittany still cidre a bit wet up front and a bit dry midbody

Oak and concomitant woodsy flavours tie the brew together without feeling inyourface but I could do with more barrel flavour myselfId guess this particular 2020 batch was aged closer to the 9 month minimum than the 36 month maximum in their claimed range and that much to its detriment I dont get barrel vanillin per se or rich toasted oak and the wine character is decidedly lacking in terms of depth of flavour I mean theres faint white wine  perhaps muted Chardonnay or Riesling  but its not as overt or nuanced as Id like

I suppose the bacteria dominate Maltwise I dont get much beyond 2row and maybe a kiss of Cantillonlike cereal grains Far from a sweet ale and I do think itd be better off fruited as noted above

OVERALL Its not a holy shit son of a bitch man youve got to try this sour ale and its not even Russian Rivers best wine barrel aged sour ale Id tend to favour Supplication in that respect but as an American imitation of Cantillons spontaneously fermented sour ales theres no doubt its rather good if not quite up there with the Allagash efforts in the category I dont know that Id shell out for it again at this price but Im glad to have gotten to try it A longtime want and a damn solid ale but I dont know that it beats the pants off your typical Belgian gueuze  many of which are easier to find than this and even as imports cost the same if not a biteen less

Im an unabashed Russian River fanboy but while its certainly rather good the creme da la creme this is not and how anyone can give this an honest to God perfect 100 rating given its obvious appearance issues and what I imagine is to many troublesome undercarbonation is beyond me

1080,Keene Idea,No No no no I cant understand how everyone takes this wellbalanced yet boring double IPA and elevates it to a godly status Its fine but the flavors scent and mouthfeel stop there As a California born dude I above all want to champion our beers This is fine but its just not the champ,0.0
1081,Keene Idea,"Many reviews talk about the perfect balance between malt and hops displayed by this beer Theyre not wrong This beer has seen the tightrope strung across the canyon of drinkability and confidently trod the cord using malt and hops as its balance beam while declining to use any of the 2020s juiciness for a safety net 

Make no mistake this is a bitter beer It demands an experienced drinkers palate but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy piney resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double IPA genes 

In reality this is an anachronism in 2022 It recalls the IBU wars of 15 years ago but remains relevant because at the end of the day its a damn good beer

Aroma is that of a really settledin beer Like this one has had some time to really develop and mature into what it is Tons of wonderful aged dates and raisins with shoe leather toffee caramel brown sugar and fig Hints of chocolate and a nice hot alcohol aroma envelopes the whole thing 

Toffee and raisins start this one off followed by a burnt char note and some piney hop and then the sweetness returns with caramel and sticky fig some papercardboard and then fades out on tobacco and molasses Very complex A bit sharp and bitter Id prefer a little more smoothness but this flavor profile is bonkers 

Feel is sticky all the way to the bank with heat throughout but a cooling center Moderate buzzing carbonation paired with warming alcohol that coats the gums and tongue Leaves a bit of resin on the finish

My first review of 2022 Yet another beer from my trade with merpunk1 This one is the highest rated Fruited Kettle Sour on BA though it’s brewed more in the Berliner Weisse style but whatever It’s also currently sitting at 105 overall here but I’m sure that’ll change soon given all the site updates as of late Let’s pop this open

Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing

I really like what the guava does to this one in the nose adding a nice funk I’m picking up on aromas of overripe mango funky guava lemon juice crackery malt and light passion fruit

It’s even better in taste still feeling unique in a world where this kind of thing is quite common On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon juice funky guava mango sorbet crackery malt passion fruit and light orange juice The swallow brings notes of tart passion fruit orange juice tart guava apple skin and pineapple

A light medium body pairs with aggressive tingling carbonation resulting in a sharp and brisk beer Finishes mostly dry and very tart

Pours a bright translucent ruby stone red with half a finger of pinkishwhite head forming and then immediately settling to a thin collar Simple but very pretty

Nose Soft grainy base with raw wheat and dusty grain silo beneath a very bright vibrant fruit layer This isnt deep saturated sweet grape but young fresh and juicy Some underlying jammy notes of red currant blackberry raspberry peak through with a deeper red wine note coming in and out of focus Some gooseberry pear and lemon notes lend brightness and fruity acidity atop a very restrained young funk presence with hay stable leather wet oak petrichor grass and topsoil 

Palate Saint Lamvinus greets the palate with a mildly tart spark paired perfectly with a thread of sweetness I believe both the grain and the fruit are lending some sugars here Bright yet musty grape with a touch of red berries abd then the brighter notes emerge showcasing lemon gooseberry white grape and unripe stone fruit With this the tartness increasing becoming fully dry with high minerality opening the door for classic Cantillon funk  sea shells salty air old wet oak hay damp soil and an almost briebloomy rind neutral musty note Some significant oak tannins emerge alongside a subtle toniclike bitterness Tartness disappears finishing with red wine cask grape skin and grapefruit pith 

MouthfeelBody This seems to have found its sweet spot with 7 ABV balancing between enough grain to lend presence but not enough to advance from the background Delicate and fluid but enough body to lend a softness Effervescence is extremely fine and gentle but still fairly fizzy Not puckering  tartness is kept in check and allows for a progression of dryness Balanced tannins 

Overall A delicate expressive and definitively Cantillon Cantillon The grape presence appears simple at first but unfurls with some subtle but complex depth pairing with just the right amount of complimentary funk The subtle suggestion of sweetness is beautiful and the lambic proceeds with these little chapters of flavour Remarkably balanced and approachable with an elegant simplicity",0.024479602454484183

1221,Double Double Cask,From the Extreme Beer selection winter 22 Pours very dark brown light head Wonderful aroma cognac and bourbon of course Taste is unbelievably complex with layers of roasted grain whiskey and top notch cognac Not overly sweet medium dry very clean finish not a fault anywhere This could easily go with any steak in 5star restaurant or as an afterdinner finish with the highest quality cheeses fruits and Belgium chocolate,0.18650096164806276
1222,Double Double Cask,"Appearance Pours a murky burnt caramel color that is clear enough if you look at it carefully the one finger beige head fades to a ringlet and archipelago while leaving a few spots behind

Smell The Armagnac puncheon and Rye casks really show their influence on the aroma though there is Bourbon in the fold as well the expected Barleywine tones of caramel raisin spice cake and vanilla there is a strong sweet cherry component too

Taste The brandied flavors of Armagnac hit the taste buds at the outset with the cherry raisin caramel and spice cake flavors emerging spicy Rye vanilla and Bourbon tones emerge in the middle with the finish being sweet and boozy

Mouthfeel Full bodied with low carbonation considerable warmth in the gullet

Overall A lot going on here perhaps too much as I dont think the Armagnac Rye and Bourbon coalesce very well and I would prefer a bit more of a hop presence to balance out the sweet cherry tones  definitely extreme though",0.061046769566735964

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This is very boozy in the nose quite sweet for an American expression if the style I’m picking up on aromas of brown sugar hot bourbon raisin sweet caramel dark bread and light vanilla

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth and boozy beer Finishes mostly dry from the booze

Nose is unexpectedly quite feeble Subtle aroma of that signature TH peachybubblegumyeasty thing but too faint to say much more than that

Bourbon Barrel Aged Sunday Brunch is a bold and dark ale that pours with a scant froth and a nearblack appearance to achieve the look of a dark roasted coffee Its decadent and roasty scent immediately strikes the nose with maple bourbon spice cocoa and coffee Its strong malty taste greets the tongue with a hearty sweetness of maple molasses caramel candied coconut and vanilla

And that decadence continues across the middle palate as the sweetness turns to a robust dark roast coffee walnut dark chocolate wrap around the caramel and cream and ushers in a bittersweet taste with nuances of charred oak coconut peppery whisky and a woodsy bitterness to offset the lingering malts

Full in body the lavish porter is mild enough in texture to mimic the feel of a nougat suggared espresso bean except with a hot chocolate under current Spiced with a bourbon inspired glaze the oaken attitude of charred woods and peppery tannins play a sweet and spicy tune on the after palate",0.20069808240170176

Mouthfeel shows a mediumlight body silkily textured and in tune with a soft prickly carbonation sporting mild gritty accents into the midpalate suggestions of distant char and balanced booziness enhance over the back end eventually leveling out to a dry roast along the palates finish

Chocolate malted chocolate dragged from the most evocative expanses of its malt profile and kissed with a softly integrated bourbon implicating a doting heat to further accentuate the already resonant roast a classic sipper its quintessence on full display",0.11688558118597887

As the flavors roll along the middle palate a strong sense of coffee cocoa and roasted walnut overcomes the sweetness and begins to usher in the bourbon complexities with charred oak vanilla coconut cherry and caramelized whisky spice Trending moderately bitter the late palate highlights a walnut character with coffeelike bitterness although all are probably hopderived

1298,Emperor Julius,"Poured from a 16oz can into pint glass in October 2022 There was a canned date of 051922 on the bottom of the can I bought this at the brewery and drank this about 3 months after purchase

Appearance Deep gold color with 2finger white head It is deep with a very hazy complexion like many New England IPAs Head is very thick and it lasts a minute leaving a small covering There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass

Smell Strong aroma of citrus and pine as well as some hops and pineapple The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas

Taste Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus The sweetness and bitter edge are wellbalanced Has a very nice aftertaste that lasts a moderate amount of time Overall a nice balance and very drinkable

Mouthfeel Medium body Average alcohol which matches the 88 listed on the can

This is an excellent New England IPA As expected similar to King Julius but with a little more citrus flavors It has a nice mix of citrus hops and other flavors which makes it enjoyable I like the overall balance and would definitely buy this again This is another great beer from Tree House and one of my favorite IPAs along with IPAs from Tired Hands and Adroit Theory",0.0

Smell Clementine orange peach apricot and mango a touch of honey

Taste Mango and peach forward with apricot and a hint of honey adding depth through the middle the Clementine orange starts to dominate moderate bitterness with a bit of bite in the aftertaste

Mouthfeel Medium to full body and creamy moderate carbonation

Yeah this was one of those beers

One of my friends went up there recently and brought down a bunch of their recent releases All were solid as was this was it was a worthy iteration of the Julius family Poured like orange juice felt like orange juice and had possibly the best head and lacing that Ive ever seen in a Tree House beer as it perfectly settled and left behind thick rings that nearly resembled a sheet Quite a sight to behold as the sensory enjoyment easily bled over into the nose and taste Loads of dewy forest dank hops apricot stone fruit turbid orange and slick juice were found in both as the smell and flavor profile of this brew were one and the same So smooth so fun and so easy to fall in love with this had a nice body hints of wheat in the taste and went down way too easily with a bit bit of dankness and floral notes staying around in the aftertaste

I have no idea how this was 88 ABV as this felt like fermented juice with some hops and a bit of tropical fruit and swamp water thrown in for fun Dated 824 on the bottom of the can with IT IS YOUR DESTINY written above it the Star Wars reference was fun just like the rest of this outstanding brew Use the force or whatever it takes to get your hands on this and thank Tree House for still killing it after all of these years",0.0

Pours a surprisingly light muddy brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to nothing and leaves no lacing

The nose here is quite pungent perhaps an artifact of 5 year old vanilla beans and cacao nibs Im picking up on aromas of cocoa powder raisin dark chocolate vanilla bean heavily roasted coffee hot bourbon light toasted oak and molasses

Whereas the nose was charmingly pungent the taste is a bit sharp and aggressive On the front end of the sip Im tasting hot bourbon burnt coffee vanilla bean dark chocolate caramel brown sugar and molasses The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon toasted oak vanilla bean cacao nibs black cherry burnt coffee toasted oak and caramel

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a sharp and boozy duh beer Finishes dry but with a serious alcoholic heat

Double Shot
Tree House Brewing
Date 18 June 2021
This is the last Tree House beer I have in my Fridge Every beer I have consumed thus far has been blown my expectations away My first stout from Tree House when I opened the can a heavy coffee aroma emitted I poured the beer into my fancy imperial stout glass The pour created a creamy and foamy dark brown twofingered head with excellent retention The color charts around SRM 26 dark brown like used motor oil without the highlights 

Coffee is strong and present with the initial nosing Dark roasted malts toffee molasses a hint of smoke a touch of char and tobacco The smell is dominated by the fragrant coffee aromas 

One of the strongest coffeeflavored beers next to Oliphant Brewing Coffee Ale The molasses caramel and toffee tempering out the bitterness This created velvety coffee flavors The dark roasted malts give some char bready and earthiness to the beer I detect

1367,Canuckley,"A Asphalt highlights to an obsidian pour that’s oily in circumference The neck tops a bone white hue with a darkened downturn of a penny toned rim Thus not much room for retention which is limiting on lace entanglements A collar that continues to lessen with a sensibility on heat for slightly etching the windowpanes

S A barrel awareness to stronghold the roasted grains with a bourbon presence The start is a molasses coating on dark fruit skins as an espresso roast loiters to the maple backs of a sickly shrewd growth Namely a syrupy tumor upon the timed warmness as malt creams the humid agilities There are light recordings of Cherry Cordials at the midriffs while maple further purifies a combating to an adjoining development in the bourbon spaces Meanwhile a balanced hop weight to avoid a suffocating middle which provides a light peppery woodiness near rearward resin Subsequently a hindmost movement from soft to mild – vanilla oak – tannins that signify a leathery convoy besides the smokeddry turfs 

T The exertion has a cask dynamism of arrogance as malt initially struggles to materialize off of burnt coffee Howbeit liquored hardihood stretches upon charred Raisinets while conveying angles to figs amp plums Some positioning on early adoptions to tire track licorice with woodsy tannin partitions which aid to reinforce those black treacle gears In succession a measure for the warming openness to adapt a caramel spread for Scottish tablets amidst the maple reinforcements on artisan Smores There is a small stake to reference trees of a deciduous nature while dabbing at coniferous pine needles This element further stretches across birch amp paperbark maple given a sharp resinous bite to kickoff the epilogs To that end a prevalence for maple to gridlock bourbon atop ruggedly pruned rawhide while citing a slowburning chimney fire

M Sharply cutting feel that’s savvy in foundation with a bitter earthiness and one to quickly smoothen out to the minute In doing so the effort is careful to not middle a cloyingness by maintaining a clean acuity to the riding sweetness There is a range of warmth that’s distinctively strong but not a concern to dictate a heated fiasco In parallel a touch of acerbic tannin throughout which works to profit the additives attributes with a slight sting to the clean amp dry cessations

O A fairly accessible presentation with a barrel presence to check the semistick extracts A tactic that’s proficient in coordinating the rich malt layers to the woodsy hop effects while bourbon perimeters all of their showpieces",0.052154198735937685

O Highly rated beer here from Transient from my home state Just got through Kentuckely which I thought was just okay Surprised to see such high ratings for this beer Kind of a competitor to CBS but with extra maple syrup and vanilla added Gets a little muddled because of that for me Little boozy and hot as well Its a decent beer I just wouldnt say its that well balanced

Brewers Notes Daily Serving was born out of our desire to express intense saturated fruit character in beer form After thoughtful experimentation with Permutation 647 and 651 we found that a base recipe similar to the German Berliner Weisse style with its delicate yet fluffy mouthfeel and evenkeeled acidity is the perfect foundation for robust fruit additions

For Twice the Daily Serving weve amplified the mouthfeel fruit addition and ABV to achieve our most expressive and luscious fruit beer to date Brewed with an outlandish amount of raspberries this beer pours a gorgeous deep ruby red color Lively aromas of homemade jam juicy raspberry and mixed berry fruit leather delight the palate It finishes fullbodied slightly sweet and remarkably drinkable

Alright once again Armsby Abbey is hooking it up with some truly legendary beer They always seem to have the craziest stuff and always a damn good selection from Hill Farmstead I’ve seen this one on the menu from time to time but never manage to make it up in time to try it so naturally I had to grab it when I saw it on today’s menu Let’s see what it’s all about

Pours a cloudy yellow gold with 2 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is bright and enticing but still carries a nice sweetness I’m picking up on aromas of lime zest bready malt cantaloupe floral hops gooseberry light white wine and white pepper

It matches the intensity in taste really striking a nice balance On the front end of the sip I’m tasting orange juice lime zest crackery malt gooseberry earthy hops light honey toasted grain and cantaloupe The swallow brings notes of white grape bready malt floral hops cantaloupe pine sap gooseberry light lime and honey

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a sharp yet creamy beer Finishes a tad sticky but dries over time

Pours a stunning pitchchestnut an almost inky appearance giving way to slight ruby accents as a bubbly halffinger of pale tan head forms slowly fizzing out to a sparse cap expansive frothing collar and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass

Aroma offers immediate impressions of jammy plum refining focus to fig subtle caramel and toffee over time as an evocative dark fruit overload springs forth across the bouquet bourbon on the back end encourages a touch of cherry and lighter cocoa to engage the close

Taste opens to layers of sugar plum raisin dates and bits of brown sugar growing in accents of bold fig and burnt caramel into the midpalate oaky vanilla meets fruitcake on the back end while leathery chocolate dusts a barrel edge with slight bourbon and smoked toffee finishing

Mouthfeel shows a medium body dense and concentrated silky textures foundational beneath a lowlying carbonation smooth wispy grit guides to a mild twang underscoring a vague burgeoning oxidation into midpalate followed by a mild barrel char and steady warmth on the back end with some stickiness into the otherwise velvety finish

500ml bottle  b6 Feb 19 poured into a fancy tulip at 48°F 

Pours an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red  Im talking The Sorcerers Stone red Highly polished highly reflective mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red  clear but not crystal A finger of quick loose justslightlypink head builds up and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar Some slow effervescence can be seen 

Nose There are average cherry wild ales and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma This is in the latter category The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated while being entirely organic in nature Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate There is some intensely sweet ripe juicy Balaton character lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note bursting with big deep dark cherry juice while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral fresh tangy cherry note with a touch of stem pit and even cherry blossom There is also a healthy amount of oak and along with the cherries seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note with just a whisper of oaky vanillins There is a suggestion of acidity but it doesnt singe the nose when inhaling and theres very little earthy or barnyard funk Just some wet oak leather old parchment dusty attic and a hint of brett The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath Theres a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything which is the icing on the cake 

Palate First thing from the very first sip it isnt bracing sourness that hits it isnt tannic oak it isnt malt its sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh The deep bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate giving up its sweet juicy goodness while never coming across as artificial cough syrupy sticky or overly sweet This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath The Montmorency is not quite as deep bold and saturated with juicy sweetness but it provides a slightly less ripe slightly fruitier character that brings Japanese cherry blossom a bit of plum a hint of cherry potpourri cinnamonamburana wood spice and a bright natural almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table In addition to this subtle fruity tartness the acidity lends a nearperfect degree of sour It really isnt bracing puckering or blinding in any way Make no mistake this is a sour ale no question about it but it isnt Midwest sour There is some lemony lacto pucker a bit less of some acetic pedio bite and a bit more of some tart funky mineralic brett lending not quite salinity and definitely not sweat but that classic restrained brett tang along with some musty wet wood a little hint of bandaid and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe The tartness has a quick downward curve allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish paired with a hint of vanilla a hint of baking spice a hint of caramel and a hint of brown sugar The sourness takes a far back seat revealing some more dusty brett and then finally the eversoslightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley cereal grains essence of cherry and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish 

MouthfeelBody MvB is light crisp and snappy by nature though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to mediumbodied territory Effervescence is surprisingly low It isnt flat but rather lazy and slow One might expect this to be a super fizzy champagnelike experience but that is not the case which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel Soft round and even quite juicy upfront the ale is not scrubbing and even feels somewhat smooth The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades but the ale itself isnt tannic or ultradry 

Overall This is a really remarkable cherry wild ale and an absolute triumph from Jester King The perceivable differences between the Montmorency and Balaton cherries is a work of art and the structure balance and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive The acidity is forward but kept in check the sweetness makes a statement up front and then takes a supporting role the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced and the subtle malty grainy base beneath it all is something that I always look for but rarely get in highly acidic ales This is just absolutely world class",0.037159994002832465

Thick caramel on the pour a truly mesmerizing mahogany colored body once collected in the glass Three fingers of thick airy khaki head with good retention I truly dont know if ive ever experienced a beer of this vivid dark wood color
Initial aromas of cream and dark fruits  raisin fig dates plum A bit of must
Taste is of sticky dark fruits  lots of plum amp fig sweet but not cloying Quite a bit of warming alcohol presence Has a slightly unpleasant medicinal cherry flavor near the end that I find somewhat distracting Notes of cream mineral water The flavor profile of the beer definitely develops a lot as the beer warms toward room temperature

1706,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Pours a deep opaque chestnutbrown with an explosive three finger head that slowly compacts over the next 4 5 minutes into a nice thin white cap These beers never look worse than ‘amazing’ in a nice goblet

Both strong and gentle complex and boozy aromas swirl in the glass I’ll try to name the most prominent they all mix and intermingle together quite well Nutty savoury and slightly spicy aromas on the nose caramel and toffee I almost always get a bit of rum like aromas on these quads and Belgian strongs Others get wine I think the high abv  whatever aroma you pick up strongest influences what you tend to associate that alcohol warmth with For me it’s always rum and raisins Definite some sweet dried dark fruits here and I primarily smell raisin and figs Possibly some dry dark cherries Caramel and toffee some savoury yeasty notes here as well in the back Some dried toasted woody grains With both the aroma and taste there are so many complexities to it I don’t think anyone can pick them all out Everyone gets it a little bit different which is just another aspect to this phenomenal beer

As with all Belgian strong beers the taste evolves significantly throughout the sip You get the strong alcohol notes up front and the spicy ones as well More of that rum soaked raisin cake delicious yeasts a touch of cinnamon but mostly nutmeg peppery like a touch of black pepper In the middle it’s nicely doughy and malty with some nice sweet dessert flavours and dried fruit coming out to play Maybe there’s a bit of dark chocolate here too Definitely figs raisins dark cherries Woody portlike flavours in the background as well Little earthy little malty on the finish Still a bit of caramel toffee and general dark fruit here

Body leans towards the fuller side and the higher alcohol certainly makes it feel thicker However the high level of carbonation gives it a very creamy mouthfeel and sip Long finish this beer finishes more dry than anything else and mildly sweet Not as sweet as the nose suggests — tempered by the peppery notes and the carbonation it keeps this beer wonderfully balanced That carbonation was surprising but has that nice gentle bite on each sip to enhance that peppery flavour 

It’s hard for me to not write the same flowery praise for any Tripel Quadrupel Dark Belgian We tend to only carry the best brewery offerings in Canada and this is a tried and true style coming from a select batch of trappists and brewers who have been making these beers for decades or even longer If you’re reading this I know I don’t really have to convince you This is good Really good Foundational stuff When you see it next grab one for you and one for your cellar you know you will not regret it",0.09331135591319847

Tons of maple on the nose its definitely the dominant characteristic followed by coffee and the rich malt base I dont get much chocolate standing out from the malt

Flavor is more balanced up front its a stout through and through The maple doesnt take long to show its presence but its a bit woodier and far less sweet than the nose This is certainly amplified by the bitterness of the coffee and chocolate The result is more in line with a breakfast beer a la Maple Bacon Coffee Porter than a dessert beer  which seems to be the goal based on the description

Maple wood semisweet chocolate coffee toffee molasses cream The flavor really grows I wasnt blown away by the first sip but Im liking it more and more

An easy trap for a beer like this is to go overboard on the sweetness While the maple winds up being the star as so often is the case when adding maple syrup its still a pretty wellbalanced beer with plenty of bitterness Its very approachable for a beer verging on double digit ABV It lets you know its pretty big but it doesnt hit you over the head with it",0.11798497593106737

Palate Waves of rich silken maltdriven fudgy roast caramel toffee cacao nib burned brown sugar and molasses lend an initial sweetness that is rich and decadent before an almost unrealistic degree of flamecharred bourbonsoaked oak barrel comes in and cuts it down quickly Big burly bourbon notes with toffee coconut pipe tobacco vanilla caviar and an almost barklike tannin structure The barrel and roast overtake the sweetness and pair together for an exquisitely lengthy finish

Overall A very nice IPA but the progeny has boosted this to the top of the IPA charts not saying it doesnt belong there but I wonder whether the subtlety would shine as much in a blind tasting",0.0

Beautiful strawberry color in the glass completely transparent if decanted  darker and murkier with the yeast however nearly completely opaque I prefer my yeast be included in my Belgians for health of course but Im not holding that against the appearance score Pale pink fizzy head brief lived leaving the body completely still

Extraordinary nose tart and fruity but equally funky earthy and sharp Earthy dirty mushroomlike funk raspberry and cherry oak and must a great example of the oftmocked horse blanket

The palate has less earthy funk but its still there especially on the back half Up front its a blend of the sharp tartness of the berries and a light white wine vinegarlike sourness Cherry skins and raspberry on the back third and finish

Strongly sour more in line with many American takes on sours and wild ales than most Belgian Lambics owing at least in part to the sharpness of the berries Mouth puckering lingering sourness about the gums Swishing swirling and chewing is almost dangerous Theres no vinegar burn however

This is world class but if more of the funkiness translated to the palate and cut through the sourness it would be among the best beers Ive ever had As it is its easily one of the best fruited Lambics in the world different in character from Cantillon but just as good Perhaps the funk becomes more pronounced with age",0.0

Nose has lovely rich velvety espresso with vanilla and milk chocolate and sure enough theres a hint of raspberries layered in there as well Inviting

The berries are much more prevalent here beginning at the first sip It starts off as just kind of a general berryfruit sweetness that builds alongside the other components I will get to in a moment to reveal a jammy decidedly raspberry note Well come back to this later The build alongside this has silky espresso and dark chocolate as well as a hint of vanilla and spice and oak from the barrel This brings us back to the raspberry You know how raspberries are actually kind of tart alongside their juicy sweetness Its one of the great things about them is they offer a balance and a range of experience and that presents here The finish has some bitter from the coffee and a bit of pucker that feels like the raspberry tartness joining the oakiness of the barrels and a bit of alcohol astringency that works well in this situation to accentuate the other flavours listed there to give it a little ooh to the finish Really enjoyable

Body is velvety smoothe and that tart finish I descibe above fades to leave behind some of the dark chocolate bitterness and a slight reminder of the alcohol contained therein Would not descibe it as hot but it isnt shy about its double digit ABV

Complex nose that you need to smell yourself to truly experience it Fruit notes of green apples pears Funky notes of general barnyard stuff hay some musty notes in there as well Somewhat of a vinous smell generic dark wine grapes here Some wooden and oaky aromas The smell is not an unrestrained Brettsuper barnyard funk that smells like a horses barn that hasn’t been cleaned and smells like crap and it’s not sour vinegary either It’s even mildly sweet 

Taste of apricots on the sip that morph into a green apple flavour Some dried lemon and tangerine peel notes here I think it’s the drying effect on your palate that give me that impression Ever spritz a citrus peel and lick the peel itself That kind of oily flavour is here but it’s miles more gentle A little bit of wheaty notes here as well like some damp whole wheat bread made with sprouted grains or something Vinous character at times like generic white wine grapes It sort of dances between a lot of different flavours and yet all of them meld together on each sip It’s more like on a particular sip a certain dancer does their solo before blending back in It’s pretty remarkable all things considered Some gentle leather like flavours that are sometimes accompanied by… a mild smoke flavour I might just be shooting blanks here but it feels like it There is not well… I don’t think it’s a savoury character to this But there is this kind of umami flavour to it Sort of like the character of blue cheese or yogurt that sort of body It’s not oily particularly because the sourness makes it more tart than anything It’s really hard to nail down this character especially as it warms and it comes out even more Thankfully… I have another in the cellar

Definitely sour but not a puckering sour There is even a mild sweetness It finishes pretty dry and surprisingly finishes quite clean as well No lingering sourness on the palate Maybe some very mild fruits and the slightest hint of sweetness which is really unique from a lot of sour beers I’ve tried Good carbonation that creates a smooth sip the carbonation is not particularly biting Medium bodied

This is my first real Geuze I’ve had plenty of sours but not a Geuze as of yet And I’ve had plenty of terrible farmyard funky sour vinegar bombs that taste like they added 10 gallons of brettanomyces This is not that This is balanced restrained and yet complex For what the style is it feels like an absolute benchmark I am by no means an expert in this arena but this is quite an experience for any beer drinker My bottle was bottled early 2018 Which made this about 4 years old when I drank it I have a second one I plan to age for another 4 years or so Can’t wait to revisit it To tide me over until then I have many other 3 Fonteinen beers to try… the framboise may be next",0.0166753540097985

Pours a deep jetpurple body with an airy halffinger of extrapale mauve head retreating quickly to a few paperthin spotty islands of cap a sizeable bubbly collar and virtually no lacing beyond an occasional splotching isolated at various points around the glass

Aroma shows fresh blackberry pits engaging with an increasingly rounded lactic funk sharpwning over time while simultaneously embracing jammy blackberry and a deepening sweetness as the beer warms old leather and wet stone peak over the middle into fresher oak and some grapelike tannins to close

Taste ooens with suggestions of blackberry quijcly overtaken by lactic funk and a splintery oak profile hints of dried peppercorn pair with a sturdy tannic structure into a midpalate of barnyard funk and lemon zest while tones of blackberry pits lactic funk and a brief burst of red berries mark the finish

Mouthfeel brings a mediumlight body with a fine moderatemild carbonation a huge acidity is sharp and biting over the midpalate acetic and puckering though crisp into back end a brief juiciness dries steadily with slight tannic textures on the finish

Increasingly palatable as it warms an overwhelming acidity remains dominant relegating the blackberry to an underdeveloped background while largely glossing over the nuance of the funk this wild ale is clearly designed competently and shows sporadic sparks of genuine depth but a relentless imbalance ultimately takes away from the overall product",0.0

Pours a deep blackberry purple  foggy anf crimson when held to the light with a lasting sudsy pinkish collar The occasional rising bubble can be seen Not as saturated but quite similar to a merlot in appearance 

Nose Really wonderful blackberry presence here That classic instantly recognisable Side Project grist and culture character forms a simple foundation with some toasty grain bright acidity and white oak with subtle threads of hay wheat dusty leather stone petrichor wet leaves and lemon The fruit is fresh vibrant and seedy with an underlying jammy element Reserved but elegant 

Palate Thicket greets the palate with a sharp zing of acidity with a ton of lactodriven lemon juice pucker and a bit of acetic bite following Like many fruited Side Project wilds theres an underlying sweetness that seems like its from both the malt as well as some fructose The sweetness tuns parallel to but beneath the sourness taming it a bit The blackberry character is unmistakable buy leans towards the dry seedy unripe tart end of the spectrum rather than juicy or saturated The acidity is aggressive and thankfully burns fast and bright settling down quickly and revealing some grains and a bit of oak Some ripe berry pokes through along with some winesoaked oak finishing quick clean and dry 

MouthfeelBody Thicket is mediumlight in body wispy fluid and crisp Puckering acidity up front causes some mouthwatering Effervescence is fine lively amd sparkly The finish is dry with some very subtle oak tannins 

Overall This is one of those wild ales that could have been stellar if it wasnt so acidic The reviews are polarising  some saying its jammy others that its crazy sour As it warms some ripe berry sweetness does begin to emerge which helps a lot and it does become enjoyable but the aggressive acidity holds it back and stifles the complexity Its certainly fruitforward and very much Side Project but it isnt the most balanced or complex offering This one is good but not amazing",0.0

Appearance Fairly cloudy amber color with generoussized thick offwhite head that slowly faded Nothing to change here

Smell Moderate pine aromas and mild sweet fruity aromas There is a bit of malty aromas also present

Taste Some sweetish malt notes first show up with some faint pine notes followed by a blast of hop bitterness The beer has that sweet taste i typically get when IPAsIIIPAs hit 10 or more ABV The beer has a fairly sweet initial taste which dies off with some lingering bitter hop notes

Mouthfeel On the light side of mediumbodied with a fairly generous level of carbonation

Appearance It has a murky orange and gold body with some shadows that are just barely visible through it The head is large thick and white The head has a consistency of whipped cream with tapiocalike bubbles It has very good retention and lacing

Aroma There is a light floral aroma with what smells like a dusty orange hard candy As a whole the aroma is pretty muted but ok

Taste The flavor kindof mimics the aroma up front there is this orange flavor which is slightly floral Towards the middle it picks up a light pith character and a bit of sweet malt flavor It finishes slightly floral

Mouthfeel Carbonation feels great The beer has a mediumlight pithy hop bitterness The body is on the lower edge of medium and smooth Drinkability is high

Overall The flavors and aromas seem good but they are a bit muted in the beer The can states that this is a ALC 105 BY VOL and it does a phenomenal job of hiding the high alcohol content The beer mostly tastes like a somewhat sweet orange hard candy which is interesting It isnt the best example of an Imperial IPA but it is still worth drinking due to the high drinkability I probably wouldnt drink it often but I wouldnt turn it down",0.03119673075391651

Appearance Pours a golden yellow orange color and fairly opaque with some visible sediment Almost 3 fingers of snowwhite foam Great head retention and lacing down the glass once the foam dissipates 
Smell Initial notes of pine and citrus including grapefruit and orange rind Lighter melon notes are also present with tangerine and apricot Caramel and cracker malts with a prevailing bitterness As the beer warms grassy and flowery notes become more prominent as the beer warms with an accompanying dankness 

Taste Holy Hops Bitterness jumps out the glass and assaults the tastebuds On the back end there is a pronounced overwhelming sweetness that really destroys the complexities of the malt backbone Its hard to make anything out besides pine and grapefruit in the first few sips More citrus notes arise after the first few sips including orange mango guava melon and lemon Earthy grassy and floral notes also become more pronounced along with a present dankness Maybe a subtle amount of cracker and caramel malts present but the malt character is underwhelming 

Feel Medium carbonation with enhances the bitterness Mouth feel is thick and usually I wouldn’t associate juiciness and bitterness but this beer seems to have both Definite alcohol warmness and a bit of a boozy aftertaste as the beer warms 

Overall This beer is solid very complex and a lot of good flavors but the sweetness is a bit overwhelming and doesn’t allow for other complexities to show Also pretty expensive at 14 for a 4pack of tall boys I don’t think I would buy it again but if it was offered to me I wouldnt turn it down and I’m glad I tried it",0.0

Aroma features an extensive malt char deftly interwoven with lager yeast and toasty brown bread as tinges of beechwood smoke and bakers chocolate over the middle engage minerality into the back end and hints of coffee on the close

Taste shows touches of leathery char and burnt coffee upfront with added nuances of bakers chocolate against a rounded lager yeast and a touch of minerality over the midpalate malt roast grazes the back end while brown bread crusts and nutty coffee grounds offer a subtle inflection on the finish

Mouthfeel brings a medium body with a mediumfull carbonation a purely silky texture seeing a sinewy backbone weaving grit and char to pseudocreamy sensations throughout the midpalate toward a firm drying and persistently roasty back end to nimble harmony on the finish

I nearly fell out of my chair when I discovered I was given this beer Hill Farmstead is on my shortlist for mustvisit breweries They have several beers I want to consume They have a bestby date to drink furthermore I am sure it is okay it is only a couple weeks past The beer was carefully maintained to preserve its integrity of the beer I poured into a Willi Belcher glass the temperature was 46 degrees A frothy and creamy threefingered dark tan head was created The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass The color charts around SRM 24 dark oily brown The appearance of the beer is beautiful 

Oh wow the malty profile is vibrant and aromatic I smell dark roasted malts chocolate medium roasted coffee a hint of floral leather intense earthiness and subtle char note 

Coffee and chocolate smack your tastes buds in the sweet spot Dark roasty malts toast bread a touch of floral a dab of Maillard a tinge of char tobacco leather earthiness and a slight herbal note is what I taste next The beer is a parade of flavors doing a technical difficult choreograph dance with precision on your palate 

The mouthfeel is a little bit bitter with some creaminess followed by a skosh of dryness 

The body is medium medium carbonation and has a long and delightful finish 

One of the best porter I have ever consumed It has all the great qualities of stout but in the porter style I love the robust flavors and creaminess with the bitterness",0.09716600815437004

Sweet right at the start but chocolate brown sugar vanilla cinnamon other spices combine with bourbon and oak One of the more complex and wonderful tastes Ive experienced Maybe a bit on the sweet and boozy side but I love it Gets better as it warms 

Mouthfeel is amazing Substantial complexity with low carbonation that suits me just right Like the taste it gets better as it warms

Having had a Framboise du Fermier earlier in the day this has a relatively toastier sesame seed cracker malt and oak interplay that is likely assisted by not being anywhere nearly as sour The frothy medium body is so much more balanced with a just lightly tart herbal peach skin presence accented by a nutty funk

Pours an oily midnightblack body capped with a modest finger and a half of dense pale mocha foam great head retention leaves a paperthin veil over an otherwise viscous void along with a large creamy collar and the occasional strand of webby lacing dotted around the walls of the glass

Aroma opens to a healthy barrel char with tinges of ashen smoke advancing to black licorice before finding predominant nutty bakers chocolate over the middle dark cocoa is enhanced by subtle caramels as a medley of dark fruits enriches delicately savory tannic qualities in the backdrop through the close

Taste brings soft vanillins into black licorice as deep bakers cocoa waves wash over splintery barrel accented with dark fruit esters whipped milk chocolate decadence on the back end finds spent coffee grounds and hints of bourbon underscoring the finish

Mouthfeel shows a body on the heavier side of medium and a moderatelow carbonation purely silky in texture with intensely focused consistency advancing to a creamy midpalate engaging a rounded sinewy grit vaguely tannic leanings into the back end are masked by moderate warmth as a subtle dryness evolves through the finish

An honest oldschool display of classic Russian imperial stout bittersweetness and borderline acridity composed in masterful flux with a tame and wellintegrated barrel effortless despite these roastier leanings this is another example of Hill Farmstead at a formulaic peak in composure",0.11602387022306428

75th unique beer from Hill Farmstead

bottled on date is Jan 10 2020

Appearance black bodied stout 12 fingers tall medium brown head Big loose bubbles break the head down into a thin cap that drops down to an uneven ring Booze legs with each sip spotty lacing on the side of the glass

Smell While taking the wax off the bottle I could immediately smell bourbon Nice bourbon note and heavy barrel char once poured into the glass Chocolate and smoke 

Taste Bourbon leads this beer with a nice sweetness and the bourbon is also lightly spicy Dark fruits brown sugar molasses amp moderately roasty malt profile Tobacco and leather Smoke peat moss and ashen barrel char begin to build after each consecutive sip deep earthy and woody character as well Umami richness in the middle of the stout Light oxidation notes in the form of soy sauce its very faint and does not distract from anything here Meaty smoke and peat moss finish that lingers for a little while after each sip Unique flavors here that I dont taste very often in barrel aged stouts its rich with mature barrel notes without being overly sweet Complex Interesting Well done bourbon barrel aged stout by Hill Farmstead

Mouthfeel Medium bodied stout Low and adequate carbonation levels Creamy carbonation Smooth and rich texture Its not motor oil and its really great exactly where it is in regards to this stouts texture Damon is not at all boozy but it does have a noticeable warming presence This stout actually drinks heftier than the 105 abv amp I do not mean this in a bad way at all Its a really robust bourbon barrel aged stout and the texture lends itself to this without being abrasive at all The beer remains smooth from fridge temperature all the way to room temperature I solo domed this bottle and drank it over the course of two hours it retained smooth sipping status the entire time 

Overall Well this beer has eluded me for a really long time Really excited for the opportunity to finally get to drink it and see what its all about I got to try port Damon back in July of this year and I think that I prefer the port barrel version just a little bit more than the bourbon barrel Hill Farmstead stouts always tend to distinguish themselves from the crowd It shows that a stout does not need to be sweet to be rich especially when the stout has such great texture",0.08453901665976551

Smell The aroma is wonderful This smells like a dark chocolate peanut butter cup Notes of roasted hazelnuts and charcoally coffee also Theres even a subtle green bell pepper and licorice aroma on the finish which is very interesting for a milk stout

Taste Interesting It is much sweeter than I was expecting And thats appropriate because this is a milk stout I think its just that from the nose I expected it to be not as sweet as it is The mouth mirrors the nose but perhaps the peanut butter flavor on the palate is much more subtle than in the aroma Also a lot of the sweetness is perceived to have an artificial sweetener vibe that is less than ideal for me The finish is long and has a nice roasty charcoally chocolatecoffee flavor

Feel Mouthfeel is relatively thick This is smooth and chewy Carbonation is spot on Really nice

Overall This is my first Tree House beer that was not a New England IPA This beer reminds me a lot of another peanut butter milk stout that I enjoyed Gunners Daughter from Mast Landing One of the differences is that Gunners Daughter does not have coffee and that Hold On To Sunshine is higher ABV Overall this is a really great coffee milk stout It was hard to choose between a 425 and 45 overall in the end I gave it a 425 because the artificial sweetener taste knocks it down slightly for me",0.08922447708520997

S Dark chocolate comes through immediately with undertones of vanilla There is a light undercurrent of cinnamon wafting in the background I take an extra strength whiff for science and only then can I start picking up some stale oxidation characteristics It is nearly imperceptible and has no real impact 

T Following closely from the nose the flavor starts off with smooth dark chocolate dominating at first with the vanilla providing ample support As the beer warms to room temperature the cinnamon starts its move from the periphery to becoming a more integral component Cinnamon is something which can easily be off putting to me in larger doses but here it is well integrated and nicely complements the stronger chocolate and vanilla flavors No perceptible heat or spiciness to me from the chile peppers Its quite possible this aspect has faded over time I do think there are some remnants adding to the total flavor profile but Im just not able to easily pick them out The only slight knock I can give is that the barrel characteristics are minimal 

M  Slightly oily with a medium body Carbonation medium has held up quite well 

O  For whatever reason I had low expectations going in for this beer after being cellared for six years However it has held up remarkably well in that time I regrettably did not have this beer when it was released so cannot give any comparison On its own its a delicious beer",0.07076598565790336
2234,Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,I received a can from FBarber in a BIF Canned on 1292020 Poured into a snulip glass I took it out of the fridge about 2 hours before pouring then put it back in about 15 minutes before pouring It pours a very dark walnut  approaching black The medium mocha head dissipated very quickly a sign of the alcohol content Lots of raisin on the nose along with roasted malt chocolate a whiff of freshlybrewed coffee and earthy charred nuts You can also readily smell the bourbon barrel This is right in my wheelhouse tastewise It opens with bakers chocolate and coffee but the raisin has carried over as well There are also notes of caramel and earthy char and the caliente pepper adds heat The bourbon barrel is strong but not distractingly so As the glass warms I think the chocolate is stronger and a bit sweeter and the pepper hotter The feel is viscous and creamy with lite carbonation and theres no avoiding the 14 ABV The 12 oz format is appropriate Overall this is a superb example of RIS  my favorite style and it richly deserves its WorldClass rating I really like the combination of the chocolate malts and dark fruit,0.17622684421256035
2235,Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"Look  Very little head with almost zero retention and no signs of much carbonation Opaque black in color
Smell  Chocolate bourbon with underlying notes of cinnamon and vanilla and subtle chiles
Taste  An almost perfect blending of Mexican chocolate and bourbon The chiles were quite noticeable but did not overwhelm in terms of flavor or heat The same can be said of the bourbon 
Feel  Mouthfeel was a touch thin on the palate but enjoyable

2238,Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"Black with a slow to build fizzy tan blanket that dies off quickly

Smell is nutty roast and dry wafer with moderately spicy cinnamon and slightly astringent but fruity and popping chili pepper

Taste has more depth yet is also refreshing with just the right amount of warming pepper that is both mildly spicy and sweetly fruity Cinnamon is lightly dusty and complements the roast of the moderately lightbodied stout Theres a touch of nutty cocoa but not a whole heckuva lot The carbonation is crisp and lifting for a big stout with tightly compacted bubbles finishing perfectly semidry

This is like an older school more drinkable stout with a lighter body and flavorings that dont overpower Additionallya shocking note for this day and ageits not cloying The only thing Im not really experiencing here is any barrel Not even a boozy heat",0.0

I enjoy Toppling Goliath Beers I have yet to try their darker beers The best by date is in a week I need to get this one gone The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass The pour created a bright white foamy and airy twofingered head The dissipation of the head left abundant lacing on the glass The color of the beer is SRM 5 pale straw with golden hues The beer is mostly clear with some haziness lurking within The appearance of the beer is elegant 

The initial aromas in the beer are pine needles grapefruit rind floral esters and herbal Nosing further in the glass I detect toasted bread crust lightly toasted malts oranges lemons papaya and a touch of solvent 

The flavors in the beer are grapefruit oranges melons lemons guava pineapple herbal floral esters bready lightly toasted malts pine needles phenols wet grass and peaches 

The mouthfeel of the beer is carbonated astringent and crisp

I’ve been waiting to have this guy for awhile as Bomb is one of my first strong stouts that I’ve ever loved Some other Prairie stouts can have too many adjuncts for me to really love but I’m hoping BA Bomb hits the ride balance First thing I notice is that it seems thinner than other Prairie stouts I’m used to There’s very little carbonation too even for a stout I wonder if the age has something to do with that Some lacing does stay though after the pour On the nose I am not getting a lot of barrel but some spice like a regular bomb I taste a bit of the pepper but not a lot I think that’s usually what goes after aging It’s sweet but not overly so There’s barrel flavor too Chocolate and vanilla notes a prominent The beer is great but I wish I had it fresh I think the aging has muted some of the best components of the beer The barrel is perfect though Great beer and worth seeking out",0.017946063401938852

A Black pour A little bit of a beige head struggles to form and ultimately fails Little to no lacing Not all that concerning for a barrel aged beer of its strength

S The chiles are much more forward on the nose than expected and that’s the first whiff emanating from the glass Heavy dose of roasty coffee next followed by a fat fudgey chocolate smell Chocolate sauce and German chocolate cake Roasted malt Oak and whiskey come out more as it warms 

T In taste it’s the massive tide of chocolate that hits first Tons of hot fudge sauce chocolate truffles German chocolate cake fatty nibs etc Lots of vanilla too mingling for a malted milkshake impression Nutty and roasty coffee brings in a mocha flavor Lots of whole chile taste too The heat is extremely mild but the flavor is big and rides to the forefront for a bit Oak and whiskey are actually the quietest component surprisingly but that sweet whiskey flavor does round things out nicely Smokey coffee and a tingle of chile heat on the finish

M Rich in body with a bit of heft Chewy and mouthcoating Velvety Low and gentle carbonation 

O A bombastic beer overall and a bit of a roller coaster ride Rather than melding into a cohesive whole each ingredient basically takes a turn reaching out and slapping you right in the palate It’s big sweet and straightforward Even a little busy if I’m being honest That’s not to say it isn’t good on the contrary I really did enjoy it If you’re a person who likes a nice “pastry stout” you’ll likely love it I think it’s a solid enough beer but its brutish approach and bold hedonistic flavors that vie for attention rather than coalescing can’t touch the more carefully composed and elite barrelaged stouts Very good but not great",0.12034225871422001

MF Medium bodied and a little bit thinner than I expected after smelling and tasting this one I guess it just lacks creaminess and is lightly frothy instead Fairly slick and oily but not syrupy The carbonation is moderate and it finishes with moderate alcohol warming and some heat from the peppers

Reminds me of a walnut caramel and chocolate cluster and I am impressed by how much the walnuts are expressed in the final brew The flavor is where things really balance out nicely but the body could be just a bit creamier if I am being honest",0.03631365196012814

Smelled of molasses cinnamon cacao and chilies This is a beautiful aroma very reminiscent of Christmas Bomb but smoother and more refined

Taste followed the nose but with pronounced maltiness that really ties the whole thing together Too often winter releases use cinnamon either to conceal deficiencies or act as second fiddle to sugar or honey Abraxas employs the chilies and cinnamon to great effect creating a flavor profile that perfectly compliments the vanilla and cacao To drink this brew is to drink mastery in action

The mouthfeel of this beer is complex Drink it before the head dissipates and you have a milkshake Drink it after the head reduces down to a 12 cap and you have a thick viscous smooth delight Very light carbonation

I paid around 25 for a 750ml bottle and it was worth every penny This is perfect for a Christmas get together or just a cold winter night Most definitely in the same class as Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza but Abraxas is the elder statesman of the group Buy it and be prepared to be amazed",0.0

Im glad I had the experience but I cant see myself getting it again Its just way too expensive for what you get The oily character was a little offputting to me and while I liked the strong raisin flavor I wasnt as fond of the maple And in no way is it experienced like something youd call beer You take careful shots theres no carbonation and its stronger than many cocktails

Aroma is cherry funk and oak Funk is more leather and tobacco like Indications of sourness but the oak gives off an old wood fibe
Taste is quite sour each sip leaves the mouth dry There is a sour cherry flavor that still gives off a brief hint of fruit sweetness At this time the funk flavor is showing less than what is in the nose but remains in the leather and tobacco expression Has quite a bit of oak tannins especially on the exhale of the breath and in the released air from the stomach

2498,Flora,"A Retention becomes an accelerated rupture shortly after the discharge which emanates a willowy throwover Nonetheless the preceding kickoff presents a spumescent elegance as the stretch reaches to inches ahead of that ensuing regression That initial onset categorizes those collared inches from Arabian Oryx to shredded coconut before the unseating takes a painter’s knife to the pebbly brim Just below is a presentation on appearance that succumbs the Golden Shield Lichen with a Tuscan sun appeal The output continues with intermittent transfers which later transcribe hues in chartreuse as shades of dim scarlet calmly intersect During the walk a growing classiness from air drafts of duration which polish an engraving collar endowment with coupled calm clarity

S Entryway is greeted by an involvedness preempted by esters and a countryside funk that’s just setting off In that regard the indulgence stretches across citrus fruits with a ploughed rusticity that incises the herbed wheat kindly The scents carry on towards cameo apples besides the pear drop to honey bananas while pink amp white grapefruit alloy the baboon lemon kind of limes There’s a touch of grainy malt for the crackery moments which respect the advancing yeast properties to umbrella remote spices In the interim a distant dank earthiness for fresh hay and cut pastures while pulling a dragged mustiness out from barnyard phenols The aerated openness channels oak to the finer points inside drycalibrated wine as a background frowzy lays horse blankets atop cellar moths The forward march is neatly acidic while continuing to press earthy must on fading rose petals before the dry amp brittle antiques of wooden leather

T A mineralogy reading for foretaste to indulge with the accompanying fruit  spices relating to the harvested derives Inferences campaign on earthy farmsteads with feedlot jazz and cultivated tobacco as a tempered acidity roots crimson red rhubarbs On balance a light malt baking to field hops with a toasted spiciness while yeast properties grind along a rural bitterness Accordingly grassy provinces with situated granaries that stow garnered wheat The vintage addresses contextual funk and pushes agricultural sulfates thru river rock mulch as fungus builds upon the airdry acclimations There’s a developing cue of Grüner Veltliner by the elongated pour for grape tinges and a furtherance for cellar natures To that end a docility on acidity as notations add oddity for woodlot ecology and slurry manure afore dry skin briefcases

M A bright light buoyancy with antiquated funk and sharp vibrancy The allotted span comes with arbitrated tartness which is moderated throughout as a compliment to the progressed barrenness Thus a thrilling attenuation that styles effervescence handily as the timed exposure madcaps the resounding involvedness from side to side upon the cleancomplete finish 

O An environmental showcase that harvests funk habitually with a touch of wheat malt in back to weigh hop efficiency The moment of service is a period of effectiveness given the dry bite for the webbed yeast densities and age aligning landlocks",0.0

2500,Coolship Red,"Bottled January 19 2017 Appearance is a rusty amber with shortlived fizzy white head Raspberries are still quite present on the nose more so than I would have expected given the age of the beer Theres some light funk oak and implied tartness to the aroma as well Definitely a nice smelling beer 

Taste is much more complex than the nose Quick tart blast up front followed by an intriguing raspberry  oak funk and a long finish that brings back a second clear wave of tartness Faint notes of apricot lurk in the background 

Overall if you like raspberries and are ok with a tart beer youll like this Im finding if somewhat of a sipper thats not quite as light and easy going down as the Tilquin Oude Gueuze I had a bit earlier but its definitely a good beer",0.0
